            <h1>Lord Hanuman comes in this jungle every 41 years</h1>
            <h3>
              We came to know about a tribe in Sri Lankan jungles of Nuwera
              Eliya. They can be classified as a sub-tribe or a Gotra within
              Veddah tribe though their way of life is completely different.
              They are very small in number but they are completely disconnected
              from modern society. To connect with them deeply, Setu Masters
              adopted their lifestyle. We came to know that their history goes
              back to Ramayana period. Lord Hanuman was given the boon of
              immortality. After death of Lord Rama, He left Ayodhya and came
              down to the jungles of south. Then He crossed the ocean again and
              landed in Sri Lanka which was being ruled by Vibhishana at that
              time. At that time He lived with this tribe in Sri Lankan jungles.
              He gave them the Brahma Jyan (The knowledge of supreme) and
              promised them that He shall visit them every 41 years to give
              Bramha Gyan to their new generation.

            <h1>Lord Hanuman visited them recently in 2014</h1>
            <h3>
              Recently this year in 2014, Lord Hanuman visited them. His next
              visit will happen after 41 years i.e. in 2055. This year, we were
              in the know of His arrival. We wanted to see Him with our physical
              eyes. We expressed our desire to head of the tribe. But we could
              not pass test of the purity required to see Lord Hanuman. We were
              told that we are not pure souls hence our eyes cannot see Him. Ar
              the time of Lord Hanuman's visit, Mathangs form a sphere of purity
              around themselves which is called "Hanu Mandal". No impure soul
              can enter into the sphere. They remain within that sphere and
              interact with Shri Hanuman. Human beings were purest in Satyuga.
              After that erosion of Sanskaras started and now in Kaliyuga we are
              not even pure enough to see the immortal Lord Hanuman Last time in
              recorded history, there is a mention of Lord Hanuman meeting
              Bheema during Mahabharata period. But Mathangs are pure till date.
              Even if little impurity surfaces in their new generation, Lord
              Hanuman comes every 41 years to purily them completely with His
              Brahma Jyan,

          <h1>What all Lord Hanuman did when He came this time? </h1>
          <h3>
            Even the birds and monkeys who live with Mathangs are purer souls
            than us human beings of mainstream society. Mathangs can talk to the
            birds and monkeys in their language. When Lord Hanuman comes to them
            every 41 years, all birds, monkeys and Mathangs worship Him in their
            own way and interact with Him. They talk to Him the way we talk to
            each other. The entire rituals and processions which are carried out
            by Mathangs in presence of Lord Hanuman are recorded by the head of
            the tribe in a "Log Book". 27th May 2014 was last day of Lord
            Hanuman's visit to Mathangs. After that we have been interacting
            with the head Mathang to figure out what all Lord Hanuman did during
            His visit and what conversations took place between them (Monkeys,
            Birds and Mathangs) and Him (Lord Hanuman). We have opened a Sadhana
            Kendram in the foothills of Piduruthalagala mountain specially to
            understand this sacred logbook. We have deciphered 3 chapters of
            this logbook so far and more are being deciphered. This website is
            the virtual temple where we are posting these sacred chapters in
            modern languages as we decipher them. If you are a devotee of Lord
            Hanuman or Lord Vishnu, Hanuman knows you. Hence do not be surprised
            if in any chapter you find a conversation where some incident of
            your present life or past lives is mentioned.
