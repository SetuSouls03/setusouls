      <h1>Who can join Sadhana program at Setuu Hanuman Bodhi</h1>
      <p>Sadhaka at Setu Hanuman Bodhi - November 29, 2015</p>

      <h5>
        Lord Hanuman is immortal. He still lives in the very world where we live. The only difference is that most human beings live in the Gross realm of body-mind while Lord Hanuman lives in the subtle realm of soul. In order to meet Lord Hanuman, one must transcend from gross realm of ordinary humans to the subtle realm of Yogis. Sadhana or meditation is the only way to do that. Setuu gives you an opportunity to do Sadhana under guidance of Setuu Masters at Setuu Hanuman Bodhi.
      </h5>

      <h4><span>You can join the Sadhana program if:</span></h4>
      <h5>(1) You have no immediate family responsibilities and you can remain completely disconnected from your family and society for at least 1 year.</h5>
      <h5>(2) You follow a minimalist lifestyle. Man-made machines like mobile phones, camera etc. are strictly prohibited at Setuu Hanuman Bodhi. These machines keep us indulged in gross reality. Therefore, it is necessary to abandon them completely during Sadhana. Furthermore, the food will be mostly fruits and raw vegetables. You should not have any medical condition which requires you to have complex food habits. You can wear comfortable clothes but they should be completely white and simple.</h5>
      <h5>(3) You have a deep soul connection with Lord Hanuman. If you have ever spoken with Lord Hanuman – in SwapanLoka (dreams) or in MaanavLoka (human world) – and Lord Hanuman has instructed you to come to Him, then your soul connection with Him is strong and you may be eligible for Sadhana.</h5>
      <h5>(4) You have no phobia from darkness and out-of-the-world things. You shall have out-of-the-world experiences from day 1 in Sadhana. You will see things which we do not usually see in the gross realm. For example, in subtle realm, you will see invisible powers like Surrahs and Asurrahs. Surrahs are positive powers and Asurrahs are negative. They can take control of your body and mind. You will do all divine activities under guidance of Setuu Masters. Therefore, no power shall harm your body-mind. But you should have a sound psyche, free from any phobia. To know whether you meet this requirement or not, look at the picture below. This was clicked by an ignorant Sadhaka secretly. You can see Asurrahs going towards the HanuMandal in this picture. If you do not feel even slightest of fear while looking at this picture, you may be eligible for the Sadhana.</h5>

      <h5>(5) You can adapt to lifestyle of mountains. Setuu Hanuman Bodhi is located in Piduru mountains 4 km above Mandaram Nuwara village. You will be required to do up-down from the Bodhi and the village for activities related to Setuu, for example to volunteer in bringing Arpanam fruits from the village to Bodhi.</h5>

      <h5>
        <span>What can you expect from 1 year of Sadhana?</span><br />
        For first 6 months, you shall do rigorous Sadhana to destroy your ‘sense of I’. When you think about yourself, you have certain assumptions which you never question. For example, when you say ‘I’, you assume that you are a person named ‘XYZ’, born to parents ‘AB’, having such and such family, such and such social circle, such and such education and so on. This assumption will break in first few months of Sadhana. You will forget your worldly identity completely. You will realize that you are a soul and body-mind is just a vehicle being driven by soul. This realization is beginning of all the Siddhis. When you are able to detach your soul from your body-mind, all the body-minds of this world will become yours. You will be able to enter any body-mind that you like. Destroying your worldly identity is also necessary to make sure that you do not misuse any of the Siddhis you attain through Sadhana.
      </h5>

      <h5>
        After 6 months of Sadhana, when your ‘sense of I’ is completely dissolved, you will be allowed to take part in Sakshat Hanuman Pooja. In this Pooja, Lord Hanuman gives His Divya Darshan inside the HanuMandal. HanuMandal is the sphere of purity created by drawing circle of special lamps in order to perform the Pooja inside it. Lord Hanuman comes in His body form in Charan Pooja which is performed every 41 years by Mathangs. Charan Pooja is different from Sakshat Hanuman Pooja. Lord Hanuman comes in His Divya form in Sakshat Hanuman Pooja which is being performed continuously in expectation of revelation of Lord Kalki’s birth.
      </h5>

      <h5>
        After 1 year of Sadhana is completed you will have three options: <br />(1) You can go back to your day-to-day life and excel in materialistic world. <br />(2) Go back to the world and spread the supreme knowledge as a messenger of Lord Hanuman. <br />(3) Join Setuu as an organizational member and stay at Setuu Hanuman Bodhi thereby continuing your Sadhana further.
      </h5>
      <h5>
