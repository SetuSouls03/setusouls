429. Gratitude towards Lord Hanuman

Dear readers, First of all I would like to express my gratitude and feeling blessed to be given this opportunity in providing my thoughts and queries to Lord Hanuman. I am a sincere devotee of lord Hanuman ever since my birth. I always have this belief that he is bonded to my soul and whatever challenges and hardship I am experiencing is HIS test to make me more confident. OM JEY SRI HANUMAN, the only mantra I have been telling before starting my prayers. Right now, I have completed my studies in engineering and looking forward for job related to my field of study. I have applied to most of the companies and it's been almost 4 months there is no call for interview. And I am getting news that few companies are not even taking in newcomers. I been through disheartened period, yet I still believe HE is saving the best one for me . Whatever situation and challenges I am put into, I am seeking Lord Hanuman blessings. I wish this would reach all devotees and I pray everyone would be blessed too. Lets be strong to face our hardship. Take care all. Jey Sri Hanuman.

430. Great dilemma whether mother who gave birth is correct or husband with whom I decided to spend life with

My husband has a very bad temper that always puts me and my people in great sorrow and shame. I have a fear that his anger and adamant nature may someday end our relation. We are from different cultures and initially my mother was not happy with the proposal. But my father and in laws supported the alliance. Eventually my mother also accepted the relation. Recently my younger sister got married within our culture. I and my husband generously supported the marriage financialy. But my mother tried to create misunderstanding about my in laws in the minds of her relatives. My husband also feels deep inside that the younger son in law will be accepted more by my parents. There has been a huge misunderstanding which I am not able to resolve.
Lord Hanuman please give me the brahma gyan to understand prabhu's leela.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

If you resolve this, something else will come up. This is part of human life. Brahma Gnan enables you to rise these human emotions so that you feel these emotions as an observer and not as a subject of these emotions. Start observing people and human emotions. Observe them like you observe waves of an ocean while you sit on a beach.

433. Great peace of mind...........!!

Jai Hanuman , कालतंतु कारेचरन्ति एनर मरिष्णु , निर्मुक्तेर कालेत्वम अमरिष्णु jai Hanumaaaaannn!!!!!

434. The greatest friend

There have been many instances in my life where I was supposed to carried away to the other world, but I am thankfully alive. I am not even 21 years old and have almost survived 5 or 6 accidents which could have been fatal. As a person who believes in GOD with my life, thanking him is not even too close to say. I usually call the male GOD as THANDE and the female one as THAAYI as they are my parents. They have fostered me and they have taken care of me in such a way that I can distinguish myself from the others. When the modern youth like to party hard, and act in the so called modern way, I like to read about Hinduism and atleast try to be a moral and an ethical person to say the least. My only wish at the end of the day is to be a good human being and a good devotee. I would like my THANDE and THAAYI to be proud of me and tell that he is my son. And I shall work for that.
Anjenaya Swamy, I am sure you won't leave my hand. I am sure you know my devotion to you. I shall always be like you wanted me to be. Thank you for everything.

435. Guidance

Raam Raamay namah.
Om Hari Markat Markataaya Namah.

My Lord,

Please guide me when will I get my eternal Guru who will guide me through the path to liberation (If I've already met with him/her, why he/she is not paying any heed to my sufferings ?). Also, please guide me through the way to find and reach the holy feet of my mother (Ofcourse, U know well. what & whom I'm talking about). Can I join your benign holy presence to spend my remaining life in your holy feet leaving behind my wordly name and relations ? Please tell me the process for the same.

Shree Seeta Raamay Namah.

Soul Mukesh.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Do not seek a Guru. Seek the supreme truth. An appropriate Guru shall automatically walk in your life in some form or formless. If you seek Guru, you are likely to get a wrong one.

jai hanumanji

Setu Speaks: 
Compare these two scenarios:

(1) Somebody tells you, "You are a good person"

(2) You yourself feel, "I am a good person"

The same information coming from two sources. When it comes from outside, it touches your mind and ego. Just imagine how would you feel when somebody else tell you that you are a good person. Your mind will react according to the image it has about the person who is saying so. Your mind will react according to the ego you have built about yourself. (Ego means sense of "I". It is not a bad thing.)

Now imagine how you would feel when you yourself feel that you are a good person. The information you receive from yourself touches your soul. You do not react to that information. You just feel it.

Now, in simple words, an information coming from Guru is received by the disciple as if the information is coming of his/her soul itself. Not from outside.

Your Guru becomes your soul.

Now , another question. See, the relationship between Guru and disciple is not at the level of body and mind. It is at the level of soul. "Men", "Women" etc are classifications based on body structure and feelings of mind. At the level of soul, we are same. Soul is not male or female, married or unmarried. Soul is Soul.

First become eligible to get the Mantra. Don't take family as a hurdle. If you have got family responsibilities, fulfill them. Practice detachment while fulfilling family responsibilities. That would be a great Sadhana.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Original Grathans are not available. The oldest copies of these texts which are available in this world are also corrupted. For supreme knowledge, Lord Hanuman's recent Leelas are the only source of which 10 chapters have been deciphered. More are being deciphered.

We have not come across any content related to the temple mentioned by you. If we get any content in Lord Hanuman's Leelas, we shall publish it.

Asurrahs are in everyone in this time of Kaliyuga. No human being is free from influence of Asurrahs. They have captured body-mind of almost all human beings. Some are fully captured by Asurrahs while some still have control on their body and mind. It has nothing to do with any religion.

Your step mother's body and mind are fully captured by Asurrahs. The only way to loose grip of Asurrahs is to show her that you are not affected by her behavior. If you show that you are getting affected and irritated by her behavior, the Asurrahs will more intensely show their colors. Just show them that you are not affected by whatever she is doing.

To have Sakshat Darshan of Lord Hanuman, you need to purify your soul. Supreme knowledge is the only way of purifying the soul.

It seems the environment at home is affecting your progress. Do not waste your energy in trying to change your step mother or anyone else. Just concentrate on your life. You will get success as there is no other obstacle.

447. Hanuma experience

Dear ALL,

This was an experience I had few years back. May be 4 years has been passed since then. It was a silent afternoon and I was alone at home reading some book about meditation/philosophy. I did not realize when I fell asleep but I clearly remember feeling as if I am pulled into darkness and I do not have any power to get out of it. The only thing I do was chant Hanuman's name asking to help me out. This is when a miracle happened!

I saw a shadow of Hanuman (With one arm in Blessing pose and holding Gadhe in his left hand). The darkness around me vanished instantly and I felt like someone telling me "I am with you".

I do not know how to express this feeling but that is the day I realized my prayers are heard by my beloved Hanuma and he came in my rescue.

Just wanted to share this with you all.

Hope someone can give a better, deeper explanation of my experience.
Thank you - Jai Bajarang Bali!

A few years ago, One day i was going to a shop to buy a file.at that shop shop i had seen Vagwat Gita published by geeta press and i bought a copy..with that copy the shopkeeper gave me a copy of hanuman chalisa.the surprising fact is that after a monyh later an astrologer also advised me to worship lord hanuman..till date i regularly worship Sankatmochan Hanuman everyday..
I think it is Mahaveer who saves me from every bad situatn of my life..one can easily get the fruits of Hari bhakti through the worship of param Ram vakt Hanuman..
He anjanisut, vayuputra, laksman prandata, sankatmochan, mahaveer, maharudra, mahaprovu Hanuman kripa korke mujhe is dukh se bahar nikaliye..

454. Hanuman- The benevolent

Sai Ram,
Jai Hanuma,
Greetings to all my brothers and sisters. It gives me immense pleasure to write my experience with Lord Hanuman to you. This was in 2012/13. I have a practice of visiting Lord Vinayaka of Kudumale, Kolar dist., Karnataka every year as a thanksgiving when my son graduates to next standard. Place called Mulbagilu, dedicated for Lord Anjaneya is very close by.( Lord Anjaneya is said to be installed by Arjuna here. Here the lord is seen with a sword and not Ghadha.)Therefore we visit him also on our every trip. On the above mentioned year, after visiting Lord Vinayaka, on the way to Anjaneya temple, I discovered Lord Narshimha's temple(it is said Lord Narshimha sat to rest here after he started off from Ahobila). So...it consumed lot of time when we were knowing the Stala purana. I knew I was late to Lord Anjaneya's temple because the temple would close in the afternoon. So I rushed my family immediately to the car. I was down hearted because I knew I was going to miss his darshan. Suddenly a sense of calmness encompassed me. I turned to my husband and said, "listen temple will be closed by now. But Hanuman will see to it that we have his darshan and then depart." Waiting to see how my faith is going to give fruit we headed towards Hanuman's temple.
Here was the twist. As we got close to the temple, I saw a man's back. I was so curious just by looking him from back. He had a matted hair. He wore a shirt and a dhothi which was dirtier than the word dirty. He was drinking tender coconut and all the monkeys had gathered around. He seemed least bothered about the world around him. I felt I should give him some money(it must be noted that this incident happened so fast than my understanding) I stopped the car and called out to that man. He turned to me and lo!!!what should I say about his beauty. I had never seen someone with such radiance on face. It was opposite to the dress what he was wearing. His eyes shined with brilliance. I was curious to see what mark he wore on his forehead. It was just some kumkum smeared across. I stretched out a note of rupees 10 and told him to eat food from that money. He just noded his head and walked away. We were awestruck looking at him, we discussed him till we reached the gate of the temple. On reaching we found the temple was closed as expected. But we had great sense of calmness that lord had kept his promise.
I being an agyani, sinful how and why did he give me darshan. Doubt started to crop in my mind. I thought about it almost every day. If it was really Hanuma why is he not removing the problems in my life. Why am I having so may confusion, stress, helplessness, defeat...
It was three months after this incident, one night I had a dream that I am in a temple of Lord bala Hanuman (bala means child) standing in namaskara mudra. I stood with my family in front of him and were praying. Suddenly I see that idol of the Lord moving. First I see his eyes moving. I am telling my family, "see the murthy has come to life. His eyes are moving. When my family begings to identify it, Lord manifests there in front of us. He said looking at me " Rama Rama Rama Sita Rama Rama Rama, Rama Rama Rama Sita Rama Rama Rama. " and he instructed me to repeat. I did accordingly. When we all chanted what he taught. I saw him, he was dancing in joy. And then...my dream broke. This was my experience which I have shared with you, other than my family. I hope that my experience is not made fun off. Thanks for all the patience you have taken to read.
If you permit me I have a question to ask. Even now at this point of time I am not peaceful. I have gone to see many saints, temples but still I can't find peace and harmony. I keep asking Lord Hanuman, why am i not chanting that mantra that you have taught? What is stopping me from attaining you?????? I am yet to get answer. Dear Setuu, if you are committed to your words please help me? I am not able to achieve tranquility of mind. Though i was so close to him what is the wall separating us?? Why is my Mukhya Prana not running in my Prana??
Waiting for your advice with all trust and love.
Radha.
Sai Ram, Jai Hanuman.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

The souls who are very close to Lord Hanuman get roller coaster of experiences, because those souls deserve Moksha. In order to assist those souls in their journey towards Moksha, He makes sure that the soul gets opposite experiences frequently. The opposite experiences means, Happiness-Sadness, Darkness-Light, ignorance-knowledge, and so on. A soul gets Moksha when the soul rises above these opposites, and doesn't indulge in any of the opposites. That is what is happening with your soul.

458. Hanuman Chalisa

Hello,
Hanuman Chalisa had been written at around 16th Century.. Does Mathangs also offer prayers through hanuman chalisa..? Its just written in 16th Century.. so was there any other method before to pray before that to Hanuman ji..? Does Hanuman ji talks about hanuman chalisa and its importance in day to day life..? Please throw some light on Hanuman Chalisa..

Thank you

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Until Treta Yuga, people could see Lord Hanuman in the Ashram of their Gurus, or randomly in mountains (away from mainstream society). There was no need of Mantras. Only a desire to meet Him was enough. In Kaliyuga, humans lost their contact with Lord Hanuman. Guru tradition was still there. Every caste/category of humans had a Guru. Those Gurus used to discover/realize (through Lord Hanuman) Mantras which were applicable only for the caste/category that Guru belonged to. That too disappeared. In the time around 16th century, communities had no Gurus. So Lord Hanuman revealed a general Mantra called Hanuman Chalisa to a sage. Because it was revealed by lord Hanuman Himself, it became famous across various communities.

Now is a very different Time. Now people are too much into visuals, very less into words. Visuals are vehicle of illusions, word is the vehicle of divine. So the word (Hanuman Chalisa) is not effective for people who are too much into visuals. Why?

A devotee in 16th/17th/18th/19th century could chant Hanuman Chalisa and visualize Lord Hanuman's Leelas as per his own vision. So even though Hanuman Chalisa was only general Mantra, each devotee had a unique manifestation from this Mantra.

Now when you chant Hanuman Chalisa, your mind visualizes scenes from various TV serials/movies related to Lord Hanuman. Those TV series/movies are not created by any sage. They are created by ordinary film makers. So your visualization of Lord Hanuman's feats is adulterated by visualization of a single person (director/writer of movie).

Perhaps, that is the reason Lord Hanuman has made His Mathang Leelas public. May be through the words being published through Setuu, people can connect better with Lord Hanuman. These words are so powerful that visuals of TV serials don't fit in mind of reader. So the reader visualizes a unique visual of Lord Hanuman. Probably this is the Time in Kaliyuga where combination of Mantras and Supreme Knowledge is necessary to connect with Him.

As far as Mathangs are concerned, they have their own Mantra of 36 lines. They do not chant Hanuman Chalisa. We had published 3 lines of this Mantra but after that Lord Hanuman did not give permission to publish more lines. Either people misused these lines or they pronounced them wrongly. Lord Hanuman will give permission to publish these 36 lines if they are meant to be for all devotees in general. Let us wait.

Blessings

We from the mortal world, we always have many endless desires in life. why we always have problems in life, is it because of the past life karma.

Once with his eyes we want to see Hanuman. want to end all this problems in life. Please ask this question to Mathangas for the Hanuman Dhrashan.

Regards
Ashok

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

If you try to find answer to this question yourself, it will help you come out of all problems of life. Instead of seeking a ready made answer, find your own answer. It will help your soul in coming back to path of Moksha where you will have Darshan of Lord Hanuman.

Blessings

466. hanuman is great

first iam thank ful to your site because day by day there is a vast change in humans
i have complete faith on hanuman , now ima in the cadre of a superintendent due to his blessings as in first chapter i read i am in illusion about this dirty world means kama krodha madam , my ambition is to chant sundara kanda like a song every day but iam not doing it but from to day i will start

467. Hanuman Heals

Whenever I have felt anxious about my health I come across Chapters of Setuu orgn. After reading the chapter I get a blessing from Lord Vishnu through Lord Hanuman

468. Hanuman - the immorta lord

i have read hanuman chalisa 108 ti,es for several times to fulfill my wishes and they actually get fulfilled within 15 days of reading hanuman chalisa.

is this true that reading hanuman chalisa 108 times fulfills my wishes and does hanumanji listens to my prayers???

hanuman is an avatar of shivji???

and last one :- The last avatra of vishnu will take birth at which place and who would be his mother??

Setu Speaks: 
Lord Hanuman works to fulfill all the wishes which reach Him. But wishes reach Him only when a devotee rises above body-mind and realizes his/her soul. In your case, you rise above body-mind by chanting Hanuman Chalisa.

Lord Shiva has many forms but He has no avatar.

Mystery of Lord Kalki is yet to be unraveled. It is still not known where He will take birth. But we will know it soon.

Blessings

469. Hanuman the Immortal soul(Pancha Mukhi Hanuman)

Seetu:

This chapter has tremendous amount of knowledge about spiritual and deep knowledge. Lord Hanuman has express the true knowlodge about soul, were are not body or mind nor anything we are completely soul. Soul can be travel any space and time without any trouble. Whoever will read this all chapter will feel the presence of hanuman and will have his darshan.

470. Hanuman Jauyanti.2-3rd April.

On the night between 2 & 3rd
April, I had a very beautiful experience, for more than an hour. However I cannot describe it in words and I hope this comes again.

I seem to be flying less of late. I don't know why.

I repeat Hanuman Chalisa 4 x 11 times a day. Sometimes I am repeating it in my dream. And sometimes I am repeating it voiceless in my mind.

I haven't started the mantra chanting as yet and don't know if I should do it voiced or unvoiced or both.

I am very grateful to Hanuman for the progress I have been making from so many problems.

My blood type is Rhesus B negative which is very rare and it seems that it is not terrestrial. What are my extra-terrestrial connections, because I see my home is in another planet and I don't belong to this world.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,
This Mantra are to be recited in the state of transcendence. In that state, time and space lose their meaning. In that state, only a soul speaks to Lord directly. The body and other parameters of physical world have no meaning.

Blessings

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Many devotees have written to us that they got Darshan of Lord Hanuman after reading first chapter. It depends on the impurities which are putting veil on your soul. It may take 1 chapter or 10 chapters to remove those impurities. Make Lord Hanuman your Guru. You will soon have His Darshan.

Blessings

482. hanuman ji k baare m meri raay

M bhagwan ko maanta tha ,manta hu
Mgr jo pehle waala maan na tha
Usme ras ki kmi thi
Bhagwan kaa name lene pr jo aanand milta hai vo heen tha
Qki m bs itna smjhta tha ki bhagwan hai kuj b maango kbi toh milega
Mgr m anjaan tha is baat se ki
Agr bhagwan ji ne apni shktio ka hi use krna hota toh sita maata ko usi time le aate jb pta lgaane gye the
Mgr bhagwan ji ne purusharth kia
Ek bhagwan hote hue b purusharth kia
Aur apne bhagto ki madad krne k liye kya kr dete hain vo mene aapki site se pda
Tb mujme ye baat jaagi ki bhagwan ji agr purusharth krte hain toh m toh ek insaan hu
M ku naa kru
Me pehle pdta ni tha dhang se
Ab purusharth kr rha hu
Aur ab baat krta hu
Vishnu ji ki
Hm har time peso k piche bhagte hain
Aur khud peso ya yu kahu sobhagya ki devi maa lakshmi jinke per dbaati hain vo svym khud bhagwan vishnu hain
Aur unhi bhagwan ne gau mata ki sewa krne k liye gwaale k roop m krishan avtaar lia
Ab khud ishwar jinki sewa krte hain
Hm insaano ka b frz bnta hai
Ki hm b unki sewa kre
Aur m ab gau sewa kr rha hu
Aur muje aanand ki prapti ho rhi hai

483. hanuman ji ka bhakt

He mahanubhav, pichle kuch salo me mera hanuman ji ke prati agadi saradha bhav man me tha unki chali dekhne matra se man bhakti bhav me doob jata tha par kuch salo idhar man me bada uthal puthal macha hua hai na hanuman man lagta hai na kisi dharmikkand me man bare bare khayal at ate hai sadi ho gai hai par aulad na hone se man anant hai kripa kar ke matangi se meri pratha na kar dijiye ki aisa ku ho raha hai mere kast hanuman ji kab karenge

485. Hanuman ji ki aseem kripa prapti

Pyare hanuman ji ,
Aapko koti koti pranam , hey prabhu jeevan me aapse maangane ki to kai ichhaaen hai jo sansarik hai par kabhi kabhi lagta hai ki itne bade aur mahaan prabhu se kya magna . Aap to sarv shaktimaan aur sarv gyata hai. Par mandiro me aap se maang bhi leta hun kyunki aakhir ek sansari hun aur ichhaaen kai hoti hai jaise pragati ki sansarik wali, aur samasyaon ka samadhan wali aadi . Prabhu kai prashno ke haal nahi milte to yah sochkar khud ko aaswashan de deta hun ki abhi jawab milna naseeb me sahi nahi hoga. So shant ho jata hun. Hey prabhu mai apne jeewan me safal nahi hun materialistic life me yani sthool life me. Par apni tarif nahi kar raha hun is kathan se ki pooja bahut karta hun aur nitya ek urja mehsoos karta hun apne sharir me jo ab bhi mehsoos ho rahi hai. Aur yeh urja sarv pratham kuch saal pehle tab mehsoos hui thi jab 7 baar roj hanuman chalisa padta tha kariban saal bhar tak. Fir sapshati diksha li to usme karte karte aur bad gayi urja. Aur jo bhi puja karta hun to wah feel hoti hai. Iska matlab divinity yani ishwariya divyata to aa gayi hai mujh me par chuki safal nahi hun stool life me to pareshani hoti hai. Aap par vishwas to hai ki yeh bhi pareshani aur kai mujse aur pariwar ki pareshaniyan dut hongi par jald ho yeh chahta hun. Aur sabse jyada safal hone ke baad is adyatm me khub badna chata hun ishwar ko aapko prapt karne ki lalsa hai. Hey prabhu hamara do plot hai jo lafde me phase hai jo indore me hai aap kripa kar unhe free karwa de to kuch paiso ki pareshani khatm ho ghar ki. Aur yeh to sansarik ichha hai khas to prabhu Aapki bhakti bade aur aapke aur ram ji prabhu ke darshano ka saubhagya prapt ho aise anant kripa jald se jald kare. Hey prabhu mujhe aisa lagta hai ki pichle janam me mai ek parrot tha jo ki kuch kuch yaad hai mujhe aur yah manushya janam uske baad mila hai shayad pehla hi hai. Is baat se kuch exp. Ka lena nahi hai bad aapko batani thi.
Kripa kare pyare prabhuji
Aapka chota sa bhakt
Vikram

Setu Speaks: 
आपके सवालों को जब साक्षात् हनुमान पूजा में रखा गया तो एक प्रतिप्रश्न प्राप्त हुआ जिस पर आपको विचार करने की जरूरत है | वह प्रतिप्रश्न है -

"मातंग भी मनुष्य हैं और इसी युग में इसी धरती पर रहते हैं | फिर हनुमान जी सिर्फ मातंगों को साक्षात् दर्शन देते हैं अन्य मनुष्यों को क्यों नहीं ?"

इसका उत्तर आपको स्वयं खोजना चाहिए |

Setu Speaks: 
दिव्य आत्मस्वरूप ,

शायद आपने हनुमान जी से जाने अनजाने में मोक्ष अथवा ब्रह्मज्ञान की इच्छा प्रकट की है | मोक्ष की इच्छा सिद्ध करने के लिए भक्त को हर तरह के अनुभव देना आवश्यक होता है - सुख दुःख , हानि लाभ , आदि आदि , ताकि भक्त इन सांसारिक अनुभवों से ऊपर उठाना सीख सके | हनुमान जी आपको परम ज्ञान की और ले जाना चाह रहे हैं |

Jai sree ram. Mera sawal ye hai ki kya iss yug may bhi hanuman ji hai agar hsi to hmare prathna ko swikar kyu nhi kar rhe hai mere kasto ka niwaran kare prabhu ji. Hm prem viwah karna chahte hai par hmare pariwar k log nhi maan rhe h aisa kyu mere sath ho rha hai jabki mere pehchan may jin logo ne prem viwah kiya unk ghar wale maan gye hai.

Setu Speaks: 
निम्न 4 बातों का ख्याल रखें -
(1) आप में अपने लक्ष्य को पूरा करने की तीव्र इच्छा होनी चाहिए |
(2) उन इच्छाओं को पूरा करने के लिए आवश्यक प्रयास करें अन्यथा आपकी आत्मा उन लक्ष्यों को इस संसार में पूरा करने की बजाय स्वपन लोक में पूरे कर लेगी |
(3) अपने दिल दिमाग में “भय” “चिंता” आदि नाम के असुरों को जगह न बनाने दे अन्यथा हनुमान जी को लगेगा कि आप उनकी बजाय असुरों को अपने दिल दिमाग में रखना पसंद करते हैं | बाधाएं दूर करने के लिए हनुमान जी की सहायता प्राप्त करने के लिय यह अति आवश्यक है |
(4) अपनी प्रार्थना को सरल रखें | अपनी प्रार्थना अपने और प्रभु के बीच रहने दें उसमे आप परिवार , समाज तथा अन्य लोगो को शामिल न करें | सही प्रार्थना - “हे प्रभु मेरी आवश्यकताए पूरी करें ताकि मै मोक्ष के मार्ग पर चल सकूँ |” गलत प्रार्थना - “मेरे जीवन में फलां व्यक्ति को ले आयें , मेरे परिवार को ऐसा करें , मेरे समाज को ऐसा करें|” आप जितने लोगो को अपनी प्रार्थना में शामिल करेंगे उतने लोगो के कर्म रोड़ा बनते जायेंगे | आपके कर्मों के रोड़े काफी हैं , किसी अन्य के रोड़े मत लायें | जब आपकी इच्छा पूरी होगी तो आपके आस पास के लोगो को खुद ब खुद सहायता मिलेगी |

493. Hanuman Ji Solved Biggest Problem of My Life, Gives Me Dream Darshan for Quick Time Frame and Suddenly I am Directed To Setuu,

Jay Shree Ram
Jay Hanuman Ji,

Hello,

Honestly, I didn't know, How I came to Setuu.org , but the ways that directed me to came here was interconnected. Here I would Like to Share My experience, not just because I really want to, but Honestly, I didn't want to share Hanuman Ji Gives me a Short quick dream darshan, where I wasn't able to see Hanuman ji's clear Face Because of the daivik Shine on Face, my eyes were not able to see. Without sharing my experience I am not able to read hanuman Ji 's leela s and brahmgyan pravachans.

This was the beginning,

I was living abroad apart from wife, and any how me and my wife couldn't get together, for visa issues. After marriage, 6 months after I came abroad and she was backhome India, and She stayed without me for 5 years, crying everyday,.

There was a Day, I was so Upset , and i don't know how, but sudden sit for praying hanuman ji and was cryingly requesting him please, Solve the biggest problem of my life , i prayed in hindi'' he hanuman ji, jese tumne shree ram or sita maiya ko firse mila diya tha, muje bhi meri wife se milado ''' from then I was sincerely Praying Hanuman Ji by chanting Hanuman Chalisa everyday, in few weeks after heared a good news for approval and Finally she approved and The 5 year 4 month wait is over and my wife is with me,

I always chanting hanuman chalisa, ...and..

There was a day , I see a dream , where I was In place were Big mountain surrounded by green forests, and I see a quick , darshan of Hanuman Ji, right infront of me and immidiately I was on my knee and spoke, Jay shree ram, '' I seen Hanuman Ji, with Very shining face, but eyes couldn't catch the face clearly, but I seen Beared, hairy body, Gadaa, ... i was On my knee and I spoke, Jay shree ram. ( I didn't Know , How suddenly That Happened).

I don't want to share it as I have that moment captured in my mind and Everyday while chanting Hanuman Chalisa, I have my closed eyes with rememebering Hajuman Ji Darshan.

Now, After that, Seriously, honestly How I came to Know about setuu.org, but I believe this all is interconnected and ( Hanuman Ji 's Leela ). brings me here to read Hanuman ji 's Leela.

****** At this Moment, Me , my wife are strongly Believing that, Hanuman Ji Protecting Their Devotees,

Jay Shree Ram
Jay Kesari Nanadan.

494. Hanuman ji Is watching the world

Jai Shri Ram , My very first experience is simple yet it is very much linked to my life .
I was already in the charans of shri hanumanji , And that is when i started getting really connected to hanumanjis leelas through emails , I had no idea hoe suddenly i started receiving information about hanumanji , As this itself says that lord Hanuman is watching each and every one in this world and trying to help each needy in this world .
JAI SHRI RAM , JAI HANUMANJI

495. Hanuman Kavach

Hello Setuu Masters,
I have been reading Panchmukhi Hanuman Kavach daily for the past two weeks and feel a lot better now a days.
I wanted to understand how sanskrit verses and shlokas for Gods and Godesses like Hanuman Kavach and Durga Kavach work.
Does playing or listening to mantras and prayers continuously help to transfer positive energy into our sub-conscious?
Any information regarding sound energy, vibration etc. will be helpful.
Thanks a lot!

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

When you transcend your mind, you reach to level of your soul. That is when you connect with God. When you are living at level of body-mind, you are disconnected from higher powers. And to help you transcend your body-mind, there are many ways. To transcend your body, you can simply close your eyes. You will cut off from entire outside world and transcend your body. But transcending mind is very difficult in this age. You start getting random thoughts which keep you tied to your mind. To transcend your mind, the word or Shabda is the key. There are words which have sounds that help you transcend your mind. Those words or pattern of words is called Mantra. And then there are words which have information attached to them that help you transcend your mind. When your mind absorbs that information, you tend to fly out of horizons of mind. Those words are called Brahm Gnan or the supreme knowledge.

Mantra is used by devotees following Bhakti Marga and BrahmGnan is used by those who are following Gnan Marga. However, in Kaliyuga, the combination of both is recommended.

Blessings

496. Hanuman my Brother and Friend

The biggest impact I felt was when i began to go beyond just prayers to Hanuman. When I began to actually imagine him in his form walk near me, sleeping next to me and having conversations with me (even casual/joking ones), it made me feel safe, never lonely and always taken care of.

497. Hanuman as my maanaseega Puthra

Hanuman!! You have always answered my prayers when it is very sincere from the deepest of my heart. But nowadays I am very distracted and not able to feel the same amount of devotion. I feel so bad about it. I feel that i approach You only when i need something. Why have i become so selfish? I want my relationship with you as something selfless, as someone who just enjoys praying you, as someone who is your mother. Also I want to learn all the nuances of music from you. Will You oblige oh Lord!! Will You oblige, my son?

Just reading the conversation that You had with the monkeys gave me goosebumps. My heart longs to see You, talk to You and be in Your company the rest of my life. I want to exprience You in every minute of my life.

With devotion,
Sowmya.

501. Hanuman Swami's Blessings

I have lived in Daman near Gujrat with my husband and kid. Even though we hail from Kerala, we went to Daman since my husband was working there. So, the house we lived in Daman, was a kind of ghost-house like. And have heard many experiences from the helper boys who stayed there, telling that during night time, somebody used to come and catch their neck. Finally no helper boy was left there because of frequent scary things happening. Finally, when my husband went to work, me and my kid would be left there. The owners were staying in the same house- One aunty, her husband and her daughter. But most of the day time, nobody would be there in the house, except me and my daughter who was 4 months then. Aunty used to go for shopping, her daughter used to go for studies and uncle used to go to his Hotel. In midst, i used to experience certain scary moments in our room. I used to feel that somebody is standing in our room and sometimes, at night somebody catching my neck etc. It was a time full of terrible experience. But when i told my concern to husband, he was not ready to believe all those. Then, finally i started praying Hanumanji daily and i could feel his presence there. Then, I started gaining inner strength. I believe that Hanuman swamy was there with us to save us from all worries. Thank you Hanuman swami. Prayers. Bless us all including all animals and birds from worries both mental and physical.
Thank you

502. Hanuman visitation on jayanit

when i read here that anyone who loves hanuman will be able to see him on hanuman jayanti between 4 and 8 pm, i did not want to miss the darshan, so i set my alarm clock for 4 pm.
as it was a hot and humid afternoon, i easily fell asleep.
just before 4 pm, the wind picked up, and all the trees were swaying, and i was slowly coming out of my sleep.
first i felt a tingling above my upper lip, and slowly the tingling came all around my mouth, as if it was swelling up. it felt as if pins were pricking me all around my mouth. it was a sensation that i have experienced for the first time in my life.
the alarm started to ring, and the sensations stopped. that is when i realized that hanuman has blessed me with darshan.
later in the evening, i and my wife went to a dance party to celebrate the darshan. i love to dance, and as i was dancing with my eyes closed, i suddenly saw hanuman sitting on the speakers!! he seemed amused to see us dancing, and said that we are all behaving like monkeys!!

main din ba din pareshaniyo main ghira rahta hu. har samay ulta sidha sochta rahta hu. karta sab ke liye acha hu par galat samjha jata hai. ji karta hai marty ko gale laga lu. agar koi upay ho pareshaniyo se nikala ka to bataye. hhanuman ji ka upasak hu. par lagta hai ki main uki bhakti kar nahi pa raha hu

Setu Speaks: 
निम्न 4 बातों का ख्याल रखें -
(1) आप में अपने लक्ष्य को पूरा करने की तीव्र इच्छा होनी चाहिए |
(2) उन इच्छाओं को पूरा करने के लिए आवश्यक प्रयास करें अन्यथा आपकी आत्मा उन लक्ष्यों को इस संसार में पूरा करने की बजाय स्वपन लोक में पूरे कर लेगी |
(3) अपने दिल दिमाग में “भय” “चिंता” आदि नाम के असुरों को जगह न बनाने दे अन्यथा हनुमान जी को लगेगा कि आप उनकी बजाय असुरों को अपने दिल दिमाग में रखना पसंद करते हैं | बाधाएं दूर करने के लिए हनुमान जी की सहायता प्राप्त करने के लिय यह अति आवश्यक है |
(4) अपनी प्रार्थना को सरल रखें | अपनी प्रार्थना अपने और प्रभु के बीच रहने दें उसमे आप परिवार , समाज तथा अन्य लोगो को शामिल न करें | सही प्रार्थना - “हे प्रभु मेरी आवश्यकताए पूरी करें ताकि मै मोक्ष के मार्ग पर चल सकूँ |” गलत प्रार्थना - “मेरे जीवन में फलां व्यक्ति को ले आयें , मेरे परिवार को ऐसा करें , मेरे समाज को ऐसा करें|” आप जितने लोगो को अपनी प्रार्थना में शामिल करेंगे उतने लोगो के कर्म रोड़ा बनते जायेंगे | आपके कर्मों के रोड़े काफी हैं , किसी अन्य के रोड़े मत लायें | जब आपकी इच्छा पूरी होगी तो आपके आस पास के लोगो को खुद ब खुद सहायता मिलेगी |

507. Hanumanji give me blessings & strength

With the grace of almighty Lord Hanuman, I got a job in a reputed software company in december 2014. My training is going on right now. But I am not able to perform well in my training. Two assessments are over and I didn't do well in any of them. May be this is because I am from Electrical and my training is in Computer or I didn't study well. I don't know.

Sometimes I think to go for Phd and sometimes I think to prepare for government jobs and sometimes I think to continue my this very job and do my best in this very field. I am really very confused. Also, I am not able to concentrate on my study(training). I don't know what to do. I don't know why all this is happening to me.

If I don't perform well in my retest, I will lose my job. My parents have lot of expectations from me. I don't want to hurt their feelings by losing this job. I want to make them proud by performing well at my job.

Please show me the right path.

If Lord Hanuman is testing me, I request him to give me blessings and strength so that I pass his test with good marks.

Hanumanji, give me blessings that I complete my training and perform well in my this very job. Prabhu please forgive me if knowingly or unknowingly I have made any mistake either in this birth or in previous births.

Jai Bajrangbali. Jai Shree Ram.

510. Hanumanji maharaj ki kripa.

I hv experience. many times in my life when was young that any worry or obstacles of life as my husbands sichness has been removed ,after I chanted 108 times Hanuman chalisa.
I felt that Bhagwan Hanumanji is my grand father and whenever I cried in desperation after getting humiliated in family life ,I experiences that Lord Hanuman ji has given me strength to cope up.I bow my head infront of Hanumanji.
I know in my heart or soul that Hanumanji is alive in this world and protecting people.I have recieved a photo of Hanuman ji ,looks very old..
Kripa ho to apke darshan sapne me karane ki bahut ichcha hai.

511. Hanumanji protected me from my bosses at work in a multinational company in mumbai

The year was 1985 .I was deputed as a unit head for our companys first budget hotel in a remote area.For reason beyond my control and due to lack of support of some directors of my company I was suddenly told one day that my services were not required as I was ineffective.This, I was aware was not true.My father advised me not to leave this job else they would say I left due to corruption from my side,

Then I was sure as always that since I am innocent and had not cheated or robbed Hanumanji would protect my job.As usual I prayed to him .But now a known Brahmin and worshiper of his advised me to say in fact the same mantra of Hanumanji several more times than I normally do.

I was troubled and harassed by these superiors for six months with cheap baits and offers.
But I prayed hard to Hanumanji as advised by my spiritual brahamin teacher.Exactly six months later I was called back to work and all became well.

The mantra I was reciting was Vadavanal Stotra and also Vichitra Vanal stotra.

Please let me have the Mathang Baba Mantra of Hanumanji as well.

513. Hanumans Blessings

Hello All... I am one among the millions and trillions who worship Chiranjevi Anajani Puthra Rama Priyaya Hanuman. I always wanted to be his true devotee & have read very few storoes of him in Ramayana & Mahabaratham. Whenever I used to read about him I will wish to see him in a temple. Once I read about Aanhaneyar in a book that comes twice in a month & I found that temple close by from where I stay. I've crossed that place a lot of times & I dint know that there was a Hanuman temple there.. I was praying & I was telling Hanuman to bless me by showing me where the temple is & attain his blessings there.. One night as usual from my office I started to home & all of a sudden there was a rain surprisingly. So I had to stop my bike for a shelter. When I parked my bike & looked the opposite side I was standing at the entrance of the street where the temple was situated. The rain then stopped & I went to the temple in the Saturday.. I was very happy since Hanuman blessed me.. I will be there frequently. There are lot more to share.. But all that I wanted to say is be true & believe in Hanuman. Hanuman will always be with. I am experiencing it all the time. I've even asked him for a chance to meet in person with his original form. Jai Shree Ram..

"Abara Karunaam Murthim Aanjaneyam Namamyeham" This means he showers his blessings on all of us. "Asathya Kariya Saadhika Aanjaneya Potri: This means he is capable of doing anything in this world. Jai Aanjaneya! Om!

514. Hanumans presence

First experience I had is when I was doing a Pooja at the alter and as soon as I closed my eyes the apple flew out of the alter and landed on me.
Second experience my family and I was coming back from a trip, reaching my house at around 1 am.my son and wife said oh my god..we just saw hanuman..I took it lightly..throughout the months I came to know and visited a very very old secluded hanuman temple at the same spot they saw him.since then that has been my constant visit.
3Rd experience. I never dreamt of any gods..nor remembered any if I did.however when I woke up it is still clear in my head, I was going up some steps into hanumans cave, and saw his troops coming down the steps amd I still kept climbing the steps to see him in the cave.i woke up.
4th experience. My dad have been dreaming alot about him since I started praying to hanuman ji.my dad was worried at one point of my declining biz and family life, hence he prayed and went to bed.he dreamt a group of monkeys surrounding him by his bed and a big big monkey was sitting next to him and he was stroking his soft and amazing fur...explained my dad.

515. hanumat

517. happiness and fear

A s a child I never needed a reason to be happy. Even as young adult it was more or less the same. But now I am afraid of being happy. I am afraid of showing happiness. When there is so much unhappiness around us, so much so that I feel I can never do anything for that, I feel guilty and I feel like holding that happiness within me. May be my experiences in life has made me so. At the same time I feel not showing happiness is like not being satisfied which is wrong. These are my thoughts. Anjaneya, I prostrate before you. Accept me and enlighten me. Namasthasyei namasthasyei namasthasyei namo namah. sri gurobhyo namah. pranams to all there.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

You are shifting from outward happiness towards inner happiness. You are moving towards inner peace and contentment. Unfortunately the way from outwards happiness to inner happiness goes via sorrows. But for you that period is also over. Now just sit back and watch yourself moving towards absolute happiness which does not depend on outer circumstances.

Blessings

518. Happy Hanuman jayanti

Dear Settu,

Sai Ram
Jai Hanuman

Today we are celebrating Hanuman jayanti here, in Andra & Karnataka. It is said that Hanuman met Mata Sitadevi in Ashoka vana on this Vaishaka suddha dashami.(jai Sri Ram).
I was not able to go to temple as I was on my 4th day of my menses. Instead I read Hanuman chalisa at home 5 times. I heard here from the mainstream society that 5 is the number for Hanuman. Like offer him any fruits in 5, coconut 5, and so on. So I recited Hanuman chalisa 5 times :)
Hope I have also joined you today in your upasana :)

Hey Anjaneya Hanumaa Ramabhakta remove the fear of death O Lord
Make my heart your residence.
Let at every blink of my eye I feel only you. Jai Hanumaa, Jai Sri Ram.

With gratitude and devotion,

519. happyness from worship

from start of the reading of the chapters from 1 i feel nothing strange with me, but when i got this mantra firstly from my brother. slowly-slowly i start chanting these mantra. now these days when i chant "sitaram" and this mantra i feel like that my body want to fly in the sky. my soul want to see hanuman ji as soon as possibly. Ofcourse i know that hanuman ji is with me all the time but i am unable to see him till this time. I am very curious to know about the true relation between me and hanuman ji. slowly-slowly I start loosing interest in this world and want badly to connect with hanuman ji properly and forever. i want the pure form of his bhakti and i believe him that somehow very soon he give me the way to find him out and see him...talk to him....

520. Have a question.....

When I am reading these chapters it appears to me that when LORD HANUMAN JI is blessing the Mathangs with supreme knowledge I am also sitting with that assembly and seeing him live. These chapters enlighten me.....

Apart from this I had a question related to the 11th chapter. When we are dreaming, we sometimes encounter the fact that we are dreaming i.e., conscious dreaming. In dreams we know that we are dreaming. Oh SETU MASTERS I want to ask that is conscious dreaming an another concept or it is somehow related to desire fulfilment. Please seek me with this concept....

A Devotee of HANUMANJI

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

When your soul is halfway between MaanavLoka and SwapanLoka, you experience what you call as conscious dreaming. It happens usually just before you are about to wake up in MaanavLoka.

Blessings

521. HE is listening

Me and my family were unable to get in touch with my brother abroad. I chanted the mantra once with a sincere prayer in my heart of my brother's safety and well being. within 5 minutes ,my brother called. I know it's sounding somewhat insignificant but since the time I have read the Lord Hanuman's leelas I have a connection with HIM :) He is more than an idol I used to see every Tuesday :)

522. Healing by lord Hanuman

Jai Sairam jai hanumannji
I am suffering some ill health and lots of pain in the body and even staying in the best country in the world all I have at disposal to treat is a bottle of pain killers just as mentioned in the first chapter here. I saw a dream of lord hanuman standing and in my sleep I started chanting hanuman chalisa . The pain reduced . Next day morning I get the link of setuu. And then the first chapter . I am full of faith that the lord will cure me soon. I hold on to Him tightly . I pray He hold on to me and heal me and set me toward His holy feet . I Pray lord cure the lameness of my body and mind . O merciful lord .
I put my prayers onto your divine feet .. My abode.
Jai veer hanuman Ji namah

524. heart felt gratitude to setuu masters, the whole mathang community, Lord Hanumanji, Supreme Lord Rama

Namaste!!

My salutes to the Supreme Being Lord Ram, Lord Hanuman and all the Divine setuu and mathang souls!!

(1) As a child I always wondered who I am and why I am, what the universe is and why there is happiness or sadness. I have anticipated for some of these answers from some point in my life, I dint have a peace of mind at all after that. My existence din’t make sense to me. Everything around me stopped making sense. I yearned for the answers, an invisible force guided me to my answers, it was like the universe was putting me in places to get me the answers, which led me on to the spiritual path. And it was this force that led me to setuu website. It is a blessing from the Divine Lord, I got peace of mind after I started reading the words of Hanumanji himself from these chapters. I always felt getting lighter or nothing at all after reading a chapter. My friends tell me I look much more happy now. I see the difference in me, I am not who I was. I am lighter, more happier and complete than before. My heart felt gratitude to setuu masters, the whole mathang community, Lord Hanumanji, Supreme Lord Rama and the entire universe for this Divine work. Thanks you!!

(2) Most of the questions I had have been answered, but I have a few more questions. Kindly, answer these questions for me. It has been explained by Hanumanji in previous chapters, how, why n when souls raise out of Muktisagar, but what was the first instance of a soul raising out of Mukti sagar and how could it have occurred? There would have been no suras and asuras then, how could have people generated good/bad karma? When did the first kalpa happen? How did this cycle of kalpa come into existence? Shukracharya, asuras and all good and bad come from the supreme lord himself. He is the creator. He must have lead to the start of all of this. What is the purpose of all these? Is this a plan for a greater progression?

(3)In previous chapters, Hanumanji said there are several worlds and each of the worlds are different and some are higher (shiva loka, vishnu loka, Brahma loka) and only the worlds closer to our world affect us. In the recent chapters, he said we have many parallel universes co-existing at the same time. What is the exact relation between these worlds and universes?

(4) The world around me and every aspect of it is very much real to me, and that is what is conveyed when end of kaliyuga is mentioned, but Hanumanji also says it is all an illusion/maya. If its only an illusion, it should be modified in a second right? Why does the Supreme Lord have to come down himself to change things? Then, is the maya described only individualistic, restricted to the way one perceives the world, and not including all aspects of existence? Are the effects of maya on an individual soul and the collective consciousness different? If an individual breaks free of this maya and attains liberation, the world would still continue to exist as it is, but does this single soul leaving effect the world anyway? I am not able to comprehend the extend of the maya. Can it me explained further?
Or, is my the thought process flawed here? my mind expects a start and end to everything, it wants everything to be linear, is this an aspect of maya, and I am not able to perceive the truth beyond the constraints of the mind?

(5) I have been meditating for past 9-10 years and I had these instances in life, when I have foreseen or fore-thought something happen and it happened. It was a different state of mind, a more grounded and connected state, thats how I perceived it. But, I never could fully get a control of the state. These instances happened more when I meditated regularly. But then, when I stopped the meditations this skill vanished away. I understand Kamadhenu cow such a state of the being, or the state of the realization of maya. Am I right? Or, am I misinterpreting these instances?

My apologies for such long para, and for the poorly framed questions. I couldn’t put them in a better way. The whole idea of maya is elusive to my mind.

Thanking you in advance,

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

In MuktiSagara, concept of TIME doesn't hold. So 'first' or 'last' doesn't make any sense in Muktisagara's perspective. For example, your soul can go to Muktisagara now and see an event which happened millions years ago (from human perspective) happening in MuktiSagara right now. We humans are used to concept of 'Time'. You need to go beyond Time to be able to witness events happening in MuktiSagara. From human perspective, there is no first. It is a cycle. There is no end and no beginning. You may find a beginning only to discover that it is just another point in the cycle. You may stop exploring and call something a beginning. But if you keep exploring, there is no beginning.

You have read about higher worlds wrongly. Shivaloka, BrahmaLoka and VishnuLoka are different. Patala and Vyahritis are different. Lord Hanuman has called 'Vyahritis' as higher worlds and 'Patalas' as lower worlds. Only 7 Vyahritis above us are perceptible to us. Only 7 Patals below us are perceptible to us. For sake of our observations, we can say that there are 7 Patals and 7 Vyahritis. But actually they are infinite. To visualize this, you may imagine that you are in a mysterious room which has doors in all 4 directions + doors on the ceiling + doors on the floor. You can exit from any door and you will get into another world. And there is no end thereafter. You may keep on going and you will find no end. If you exit from the doors in the ceiling, you are going higher. The worlds which exist beyond those doors are 'higher worlds' or vyahritis. Similarly the worlds which exist beyond the doors in the floor are called Patals or lower worlds. The doors in the 4 walls of the room lead to parallel worlds.

the words you have written in paragraph 4 should be meditated upon deeply by you. These are divine words which show that you were in a very high level of consciousness when you wrote them. Here is a hint which will help you in sailing in correct direction :
Suppose you do not have any identity. You are in complete darkness. Then you happen to find a box. You open the box and discover a identity and whole universe which comes with an identity. Within a second you start identifying yourself as a human which is in MaanavLoka where Lord Vishnu is expected to come for welfare of the world. When you close this box again, you again lose everything and go into complete darkness. You forget about humans, MaanavLoka, Lord Vishnu and everything. You are in that box right now. Lord Vishnu is the power which helps you realize that you are in a box. You have written this paragraph by the blessings of Lord Vishnu. If you manage to come out if this box, it will be thanks to Lord Vishnu. Coming out of this box means attaining Moksha.

Kaamdhenu is when you don't come out of the box but get the ability to jump from one box to another.

525. Heaviness in head

A friend of mine suggested this website yesterday. Today I read the first chapter fully. I don't feel wow but stunned that how connected we all are and that we are all part of an illusion. Felt heaviness in the back of my head initially. Later slightly dizzy. Should I continue reading? I am a Christian and have not done arpan before. What does it mean? If I make an arpan, what am I committing myself to?
I felt some energy in my body while reading this first chapter. Am I feeling outside energy because my own energy is weak? Please help, jai guru dev.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Dizziness and heaviness may happen because first chapter creates a strong disillusionment about the world in the reader. It basically switches you one layer up from your bodily identity towards your soul identity. Switching from smaller identity to larger identity involves energy which you feel flowing towards you.

Arpanam can be done to any deity you worship. It is a commitment to the deity that, "I have switched to a higher identity by reading this chapter and I do not wish to fall back on the smaller identity." .... OR "I have taken one step towards realization of supreme truth and I don't want to go back". Arpanam should be done immediately after feeling that energy as you have described. Fruits or flowers can be offered to deity at home or temple.

I am 32 years old and am living in a state of indecision not knowing what to do. I am working as a banker but not satisfied. I have worked as software engineer but was not very happy . I feel something is missing in me but don't know what is that? I take Ram's name I remember Lord Hanuman several times but don't find him anywhere? I want to be on the right path as Lord krishna says you do my duty i will take care of you. What is that Lord krishna wants me to do?
What was i in my previous birth?

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

one should always have a higher purpose in life like Moksha or getting supreme knowledge. Then only you get peace, happiness and satisfaction in life. Ultimate destiny of every soul is Moksha or liberation from the mortal worlds. If a soul has reached to a certain level on path of Moksha in previous birth, but in present birth has completely forgotten it's purpose of life, this kind of feeling of disturbance arise. You don't need to know details of your previous births in order to resume your journey. When you start it, you will realize that you are already evolved to a certain level. You don't have to start afresh. You can resume from where you stopped in previous birth.

530. Help me please.

Jai Sriram,

Continued from #499073.

I understand intellectually that all that happens ,happen for a reason. My fear of worshipping God came from the fear of unforgiving parents who gave me cruel punishments and mental torture. I am ashamed to say that today I am a person with very low self-esteem , afraid of people and indecisive. I have this belief that if parents themselves don't understand kids and punish them cruelly why wouldn't God do the same?

Kindly answer me.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

At least feel blessed that you have a different perspective from the crowd. While most people worship parents because of the love they get from them, you have a completely different experience. Hence you are at an advantageous position as far as perspective is concerned. When you have a different perspective from others, you are closer to God because it become easier for you to rise above body-mind and live at the level of soul.

Think like this. That is how you amend the past and move towards a better future.If you remain stuck with the bad memories of past, the future wont come out good either.

Hi

Thanks for bringing light to me. After reading I got lots of answer in my life

However I have few queries

From Past almost 6 months
Most of time I have depression and unhappy from my life. Recently looks like I am being sort tempered getting angry quickly and fearful

Please help

Bhavesh

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

You are blessed one. Lord Hanuman wants you to observe who is getting short-tempered and who is getting angry. It is not you. When you get angry, just watch yourself. This is a way of Lord Hanuman to teach His disciples. Just observe yourself. There is no need to suppress these feelings and no need to feel bad about it. He wants you to separate your body-mind and soul. The anger comes in body-mind. You are a soul, not body-mind.

532. Help Required

My self always believe that we all are child of lord Hanuman and I feel from child hood that I am a part OR an extension of lord Hanuman soul. I always prayer only lord Hanuman and fully devoted to them. Also after getting membership of "Setuu" and reading there chapters, I feel my cleanness of my soul from dust.

But, from last 1-2 years, nothing is going positive in my life and all thing goes wrong OR unhealthy. It gave me feeling that Lord Hanuman is not happy with my soul, it may be possible that something goes wrongly by my work which can hurt the lord.

I want to ask lord Hanuman through your team of Matang's , please let me know my mistake and it's solution, so that my life will again go smoothly and my all work will be done positively and myself leave the life with his blessing.

Awaiting your revert.

Thanks & Regards,

Rajesh

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,
Anger and Cheer are Lord Hanuman's Leelas to bring a devotee on right path. It doesn't mean that He doesn't care for you. Those souls who are not connected to Him neither get anger nor cheer from him. So, even if you have faced His anger, that means your soul is connected to Him and He loves you.
Just take care of these 4 things-
(1) Make sure you have a deep desire to reach goals : Be it materialistic goal or Moksha.
(2) Make sufficient efforts required to fulfill that desire otherwise your soul will just go to Swapan Lok and fulfill those deep desires. It will never become reality here in this world.
(3) In order to get help of Lord Hanuman in removing obstacles, never allow demons of "fear", "worry", “doubt”, “victimhood” etc make room in your heart and mind. If these demons remain there, you will not get help of Lord Hanuman. Because that would indicate that you prefer demons over Lord Hanuman.
(4) Keep your prayer simple. Just ask, "O Lord, fulfill my wishes." Do not bring your family, society and world into your wish. Otherwise their Karma will also affect you. Just keep it between you and Lord. Nobody else. Everyone related to you will automatically get fruits when your wish gets fulfilled.

533. Help & Support

Setu Speaks: 
दिव्य आत्मस्वरूप ,

इस बारे में इंद्र देव ने ११ वे अध्याय में बताया है | अगर आपके कर्म (इस जन्म और पिछले जन्म मिलाकर) योग्य हों तब इच्छा पूरी होती है | यह बहुत पेचीदा प्रश्न है और इसके कई पहलु हैं | अगर आप चाहे तो पिछले जन्मों के सभी कर्म शुद्ध कर सकते हैं | शुद्धिकरण का एक तरीका १२ वे अध्याय में बताया गया है | आगे के अध्यायों में भी कुछ पहलु सामने आयेंगे |

एक बात ये भी है कि माता पिता अथवा किसी भी अन्य व्यक्ति को अपनी इच्छा में सम्मिलित मत कीजिये | इससे उनके कर्म भी आपके कर्मों में जुड़ जाते हैं |

ज्योतिष मात्र एक गणना है जो सही भी हो सकती है और गलत भी | उस गणना के आधार पर हार मान लेना गलत है |

हर आत्मा का उद्देश्य मोक्ष होना चाहिए | तभी जीवन में संतोष और शांति आती है | उदाहरण के तौर पर , यहाँ पर एक भक्त ने कुछ महीने पहले इच्छा प्रकट की थी कि सरकारी नौकरी मिले | वह उसे मिल गई | अब हाल ही में उसने लिखा कि नौकरी तो मिल गई किन्तु मुझे शराब की लत लग गई है , उससे छुटकारा दिलाइये | जब यह इच्छा भी पूर्ण हो जायेगी तो कोई और इच्छा आ जायेगी | ऐसा जीवं पशु के जीवन के समान है : जहाँ घास मिला उधर हो लिए | इसलिए बड़ी इच्छा रखिये - मोक्ष की इच्छा रखिये | बाकी इच्छाएं शांति कभी नहीं ला पाएंगी |

541. Hope that Future will be good

"Continued from #495374"

Thanks for the quick reply. I must say after going through your reply a positive energy comes to me and I feel more energetic and confident than before.
I don't think about what people think about me. People say so many things behind me and in front of me too. But I try to ignore everything and focus on my work.
Forget people, sometimes even I start thinking about myself. It has been almost more than a year and I am not able to get a good job. Time is passing and I am not able to stand on my feet. Still I am dependent on my parents. I don't understand what and where the problem is. Why I am not getting a good job of my liking? Are my Karmas not enough to get a good job of my liking?
Not always but sometimes I really get depressed, frustrated and worried regarding my career. Even after studying so much, I am not able to grab a job yet. Many of my friends and others get job just after B.Tech. I did M.Tech and too from one of the premier colleges of the country but I am finding it hard to get a good job. I am not comparing myself with others or my friends. I am just saying. I know everyone's Karma is different. I have been a good student since childhood but I don't know why I am facing so many problems in getting a good job.
But I have full faith in Hanumanji and I believe soon he will give me a very good job. I don't know what he has thought for me. But whatever he has thought for me must be good for me in the long run. He must have something bigger and better for me.
And I believe in your words too Setuu. You have told me Accept the past, live in the present. Do your Karma without any worry, Future will be good. If you are saying that my future will be good, then, I am sure my future will really be good.
I have started reading Sunderkand. I read 12 dohas everyday and in this way Sunderkand will be completed in 5 days and the cycle will be repeated. Also, I have started chanting Hanuman Chalisa 11 times or more everyday.
My Pranam to Setuu Masters and Mathangs.
Thanks and regards.

Jai Shree Ram
Jai Hanuman

542. Horrible Feeling

My dear Lord Hanuman,

I am going through a very bad stage now. My mind is experiencing a kind of fear that i become mad or something. I feel very low nowadays. especially after my marriage. Its been 5 years since i got married and i m really unhappy. I have a daughter now. But throughout my married life, i had bitter experiences only. I have no day without crying. Even my husband was careless on me, even sometimes i feel hes still the same now.
In 2012, I have been working in a firm. During that time, i stayed in my home and travelled to the job place. And each weekend, my husband used to take me to his home, just for the sake of showing other people that i visit my husband's home. Neither he nor his parents talked to me with compassion or love. They saw me as some girl from outside. I have never felt any attachment towards them. Initially, even though i considered all of them as my close people, eventually, they proved that they are not as sincere or genuine as me or my parents. And later, since i suffered from certain mental problems, I was taken to a Psychiatrist. And then later, i was almost cured from my big problems which i suffered mentally. Even now, im taking my medicines, prescribed by the Psychiatrist.

Now, again, i have started feeling the same suffocation i used to experience before. And now, what im thinking more and making me kind of mad is i couldnt marry a person of my wish or i didnt get the person i liked.

Hanumanji, please save me from all these unnecessary worldly thoughts, and kindly help me live in midst of peace and happiness, and also good people around me, who doesnt hurt my feelings. Bless me Hanuman swamy. Please save me from all fears, anxieties, evils, tensions and other health problems.

Please hear my Prayer Hanuman Swamy

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

If an animal wants to hurt a human, human can climb to a higher place like a tree where animal cannot reach.

Everyone of us has a higher place to climb. That higher place is our soul. People can hurt mind, not the soul. Rise to the level of soul and then enjoy the drama being created by ignorant people. Recognize your soul. Your circumstances are an opportunity in disguise.

543. How to be free from Desires and Attractions?

O Lord Please give some clarity!!!
To lead a peaceful life- a Desire.
To lead a financially secured life- a Desire.
To lead a successful and stress-free life - a Desire.
To bring up children as useful citizens- a Desire.
These seem noble..

To experience every possible comfort - a Desire.
To experience richness and power - a Desire.
To experience pollution free environment -a Desire.
These seem selfish...

To do a disturbance -free penance and impress God- a Desire.
To be able to become one with the Para Brahman- a Desire
These seem spiritual....

Without desire I am unable to live. I am so weak to resist any sort of attraction. How can I overcome this problem?
Everyday if one swtiches his TV on, many advertisements show casing many Yantras (like Shani Hanumathe Kavach) and other spiritual related goods like rudrakshaas, pendants etc are being aired. Is this the correct way to pursue buying them or is there any way to reach one's own inner self?

O Guru!!! Please enlighten!!!

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,
Do not believe in superstitions. If you want to fulfill your desires, here are the 4 things you need to take care of:

(1) Make sure you have a deep desire to reach goals.
(2) Make sufficient efforts required to fulfill that desire otherwise your soul will just go to Swapan Lok and fulfill those deep desires. It will never become reality here in this world.
(3) In order to get help of Lord Hanuman in removing obstacles, never allow demons of "fear" and "worry" etc make room in your heart and mind. If these demons remain there, you will not get help of Lord Hanuman. Because that would indicate that you prefer demons over Lord Hanuman.
(4) Keep your prayer simple. Just ask, "O Lord, fulfill my wishes." Do not bring your family, society and world into your wish. Otherwise their Karma will also affect you. Just keep it between you and Lord. Nobody else. Everyone related to you will automatically get fruits when your wish gets fulfilled.

544. How to be liberated inside the world

Jai Shri Ram
Jai Shri Hanuman
Pranaam,
I am a 21 year old male currently pursuing my Engineering. I have no shortage of anything in life due to Prabhu's grace. Every time I am in danger, Prabhu comes to my rescue. My Lord is always watching me.

As mentioned earlier, I do not lack anything in life. I have a great family, a good future and no financial issues. However, due to the immense blessings of my Lord, I have a spiritual bent of mind. While I am attracted towards questions like "Who am I", it is the bhakti of My Lord that gives me the most joy. Listening to my Lord's Leelas often brings me to tears. I know that the form of Bhakti I have is lowly and that it is due to His infinite kindness that Lord Hanuman has taken care of me. However, I still do not have a burning desire for his Darshan. I feel that maybe this is because the time has not yet arrived but I know that I love My Lord a lot. Even when I am in difficult situations, I know that my Lord will do nothing that can harm me. So every bad situation is a blessing in disguise that removes my bad karma.

What I want to know, however, is that how can I attain Moksha while being in the world. While I am ready to give up everything (not at the moment though, I will prepare my body first) for Moksha, I feel that I have a sense of duty towards my parents. They spent their entire life for me so it's my duty as a son to see to it that they receive all the happiness in their old age. I know, this may be a form of attachment, but still, I am ready to leave everything after they depart their worldly bodies. I want to provide them with all the happiness possible. I will take on any bad karma if it removes their sorrows.

Therefore, Dear Setuu Masters, I want you to guide me, as to what to do next? I feel that Lord Hanuman will talk through you and provide me with answers. I have received some answers. Some answers remain. Please guide me. I know that by the Grace of Lord Hanuman, I will surely get advice.
Sorry for the long post, I just wanted you to know my situation.
I look forward to your words of wisdom.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

To Grihastha Sadhakas, we can only suggest reading Lord Hanuman's Leelas being published here. You should fulfill your family responsibilities sincerely. Your words suggest that you are a sincere seeker. When there is a sincere seeking of supreme knowledge, there is a Guru. That Guru can be invisible, That Guru may or may not be human, That Guru can be Lord Hanuman Himself. You must be having a Guru around you. Recognize that Guru. He will create situations in your life in order to impart supreme knowledge. Observe those situations. While your boy-mind are performing worldly duties, at the same time your soul can remain connected with the Guru. Then your life itself will become a Sadhana. Then you will be on path of Moksha.

545. How to be a perfect human

with people around us, with different characters i am finding it hard to digest their selfish characters. Please advice

Setu Speaks: 
Lord Hanuman says,

It is good that banks of a river does not attract the impurities towards it. Let the impurities flow in the river. If banks of the river start collecting the impurities, river will start shrinking and one day it will disappear. Only impurities will remain. When you look at the impurities flowing in the water, do not say- ,"Impurities are so lucky. They are enjoying the ride in the river." Instead say- "I am the banks of the river. I have bigger responsibilities."

546. How to be sure that you are on right path now...

I would like to know that in our life we choose so many different paths, and due to this sometimes get confused about the correct one. How can we make us assured that we are on right path.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Right path is a relative term. Set your goals first. At a given time, with all the information and authority at your command, if a path looks right for your goal, you should follow that path.

If your goal is Moksha, Just observe how do you feel while following a path. If you feel connected with the higher reality while following the path, you are on a right path.

547. HOW CAN I DEVELOP A STRONG BELIEF TOWARDS LORD HANUMAN

"continued from experience 513746"
जय श्री राम
जय श्री हनुमान जी
हे प्रिय मातंग ऋषियों आपको चरण स्पर्श।
मैं दो महीने पहले setuuसे जुड़ा। तब मैं श्री हनुमान की भक्ति में खो गया,मुझे हर तरफ हनुमान जी महसूस होने लगे। तभी मैं एक परीक्षा में सफल हुआ लेकिन मुख्य परीक्षा में सफल नहीं हो पाया फिर मेरे अन्दर भक्ति कम हो गयी लेकिन मैंने आपके अध्यायों को पढ़कर थोड़ा बहुत जो नालेज पाया हूँ वही मुझे भगवान से जुड़ने की ताकत दे रहा है।
मैं और किस प्रकार श्री हनुमान जी से मजबूती से जुड़ सकता हूँ।क्या मेरा स्वार्थ मेरी कमजोरी है? अभी मैं अपने जीवन की कठिन परिस्थितियों से गुजर रहा हूँ। मेरे माता पिता जब किसी पंडित या ज्योतिषियों से मेरे समस्याओं का समाधान पूछते हैं तो वो लोग मुझे श्री हनुमान जी की पूजा करने की सलाह देते हैं और वानर को चना खिलाने को कहते हैं। मैं हर मंगलवार व्रत भी रखता हूँ जिससे मुझे अच्छा अनुभव होता है।
मैं श्री हनुमान जी से किस प्रकार जुड़ा हूँ और मैं कैसे उनसे मजबूती से जुड़ सकता हूँ,ताकि मेरे कर्म मेरी सफलता के लायक बनें।मेरा मार्गदर्शन करने की कृपा करें।
।।श्री राम।।

Setu Speaks: 
दिव्य आत्मस्वरूप ,

अपनी भक्ति को सांसारिक सफलताओं और असफलताओं से न जोडीये | हनुमान जी की भक्ति को मोक्ष से जोडीये , फिर भक्ति प्रगाढ़ होगी और सांसारिक चीजे अपने आप पटरी पर आ जायेंगी

548. How can a student grow in his career and spirituality at the same time

Jai Hanuman.
I'm kalyan a medical student. I don't remember how i came to know about setuu but since the day i first read the first chapter my life or to be precise my view about the world has completely changed. It was like lord hanuman wanted me to follow his path. It is a great blessing for me. I am kinda interested in spirituality since my childhood. I used to go to hanuman temple every Saturday all my childhood untill i was kept in hostel for further studies. But after knowing about lord hanuman return after 42 years love for spiritual path in me has increased tremendously. I think it is only because of lord hanuman's blessings. Thank you so much setuu for connecting my lord with me again.

Here's my question:
Since im a student i have to continue my career and be part of family. Since I'm the elder son and lost my father when i was 12years old i have a lot of responsibilities for the family. I'm a little short tempered also which i want to change all the time but couldn't do it. Can you help me in enlightening me with this knowledge of how to manage both family and spiritual life parallelly and how to get off the anger from me. Thank you. Jai hanuman.

Setu Speaks: 
Chapter 27 answers your question.

549. How can we get associated with lord ?

Its always said that human life is very precious and being in materialistic world we are always busy in various other activities which does not serve the purpose in true sense of getting the ultimate goal of human life.
It seems so hard to be left pure as these blessed tribes are in this world so the chance of getting interacted to lord Hanuman ji is very less. Lord Krishna or Ram is said to be the ultimate supreme in the universe so is there anyway we can get directions from Lord Hanuman ji to get Lord Krishna in our lives. I mean to say if Lord Hanuman can guide us a way like Guru. Since lord Hanuman is nearest and dearest to Lord Krishna and Ram.
I urge to leave this body and get my tiny soul be the part of ultimate soul of that Prmatma or to remain in the consciousness of Lord so as to serve throughout. Since being human we are always indulge in the materialistic activities and slave to the maya and moh. How can we be associated to lord and can get escape from this annoying experience of repeated births and not getting what we are looking for.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Lord Hanuman comes to the Mathangs to give them Brahmagyan. Whatever He has spoken, He has spoken to unsettle the structured belief of the new generation of Mathangs and to make room for the BrahmaGyan. Therefore If you accept Him as your Guru and follow the conversation between Him and Mathangs, we can assure you that you will also get the Brahmagyan. We are translating the Log Book. Do read every chapter as we post them. We will be posting second chapter shortly.

Blessings.

550. How is caste of a person correctly determined?

Dear Setuu Team,
Is the caste of a person supposed to be determined by his birth or by his profession?
Thank you.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

As described in chapter 20, humans create systems of classification for smooth functioning of society but these systems turn out to be faulty and have to be chucked or repaired over time. Firstly, no human designed system is perfect. Secondly, when times change, almost all systems get infested with social evils. No system is flexible enough to last forever. Current caste system is beyond repair.

To answer your question, caste of a person cannot be determined by birth. That can be implemented if all children, no matter what their parentage is, are admitted in an education system which gives equal opportunity. Their caste should be determined after graduating from that education system, based on how their characters develop.

551. how to chant om mantra

जय श्री राम
जय श्री हनुमान
मातंग ऋषिओं को मेरा प्रणाम एवं नमन
मैं लगभग तीन महीने से ॐ मंत्र का उच्चारण कर रहा हूँ। परन्तु मुझे इसका सही उच्चारण नहीं पता। अगर मैं इसे तेज ध्वनि में उच्चारण करता हूँ, तो इसका अलग प्रभाव दिखता है। पर यदि धीमी आवाज में उच्चारण करता हूँ तो इसका अलग प्रभाव दिखता है।
मैं अपने आप ही ओम मंत्र का उच्चारण करने लगा था। मुझे पता है कि ये सब श्री हनुमान जी की कृपा है। ओम मंत्र की महत्ता का मुझे पहले पता नहीं था। लेकिन जबसे मैंने इसका उच्चारण आरंभ किया तब से मैं ऐसे अनुभव किया कि उसे शब्दों में नहीं बता सकता। इतना कह सकता हूँ कि ये मंत्र हमें ईश्वर के करीब ले आता है।
कृपया मुझे बताये इस मंत्र के बारे बतायें। क्या श्री हनुमान जी ने कभी इसकी उत्पत्ति के बारे में कुछ बताया है।
कृपया मुझे इस मंत्र के उच्चारण का सही तरीका बतायें।
जय सीता राम
जय हनुमान
अपनी कृपा बनायें रखें।

Setu Speaks: 
दिव्य आत्मस्वरूप ,

हनुमान जी ने विश्व की हर चीज के बारे में विस्तार से बताया है लेकिन उनकी लीलाओं को समझने में हमें समय लग रहा है | आप आने वाले अध्यायों में धीरे धीरे विश्व का सारा ज्ञान प्राप्त करेंगे |

552. How to communicate with our own Antaryamin?

Pada Pranams to the Lotus feet of Shree Hanumaan ji.
Namashkaar Setuu Masters & Mathangs
What is sadhana/ contemplation required to achieve Mukthi & God Realization? Is love and devotion towards the Aaradhya alone enough for that? Humans beings are stucked at various levels such that they are unable to seek the real path to Enlightment. Please guide us and help us to understand its necessity with your incredible wisdom.
What is the way to recognize and communicate with our own Antaryamin?
I completely believe that the phenomenon of Kalki has already descended on Earth to save the Humanity and make the righteous stand for the coming ages because kali yuga is at its peak. Please enlighten us about it.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

In Kaliyuga the illusion is at such a peak that you may be in illusion that you are devoted to Lord but actually you may be entertaining the Asurrahs residing in your body-mind. Therefore, at this point, only the supreme knowledge is that sword which can break the illusion and help us realize the supreme truth. Lord Hanuman is imparting that knowledge through these chapters and Lord Kalki will have His own ways to do so.

553. How to concentrate on aim

"Continued from #46195"

Jai Bajrangbali
Jai Shree Ram

As I have mentioned in my previous experience that I didn't do well in my first two exams of training, I am not getting peace of mind. All the time, fear of losing the job comes to my mind. Also, I am not able to concentrate on my study for further exams. I am really very much disturbed.

I don't know why all this is happening to me. All the time I just keep on thinking how will I complete my training and save my job. Every time I pray to Lord Hanuman for my job.

I just want to know if Lord Hanuman is testing me by creating such situations? I have been in such situations earlier too. Every time I came out of it with the grace of Lord Hanuman. I always think nothing wrong can happen to me as Lord Hanuman is always there to protect me.

Once you told me that even the greatest bhakts of Lord Hanuman have to go through many difficulties to reach very close to Lord Hanuman. Is my present situation similar to or related to it? I also want to be very close to Lord Hanuman. I am just a mere ignorant bhakt of Lord Hanuman. I don't know what Prabhu has thought for me. May be he is doing all this thinking of my long term benefit and I am not able to recognize it because I am looking for my short term benefit. Also, I don't know about my karms in my previous births.

Such thoughts always come to my mind. I don't know whether this is right or wrong. I am saying all this to you so that you may tell what is right. Also, after going through your reply I really feel relieved and feel good and confidence come to me. And I think I have moved one more step closer to Lord Hanuman following your advices. Please forgive me thinking as an ignorant if I said anything wrong.

Right now I am really very disturbed. All the time, fear of losing the job comes to my mind. I am not able to concentrate on my study. I really need to concentrate on my study seriously and pass all my tests and retests and complete my training. Please show me the way.

Jai Bajrangbali
Jai Shree Ram

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

If you have full faith in Lord Hanuman, you cannot have fear. Leave everything on Him and just do your work. He knows what is good for you and what is bad in long term. He knows what to give you at what time.

554. How do I know and when do I know that i become eligible for sadhana

Before reading your answer I thought i was in spirituality but you said that
"He would think that he is in to spiritually but actually he would be in to an illusion of spirituality created by Maya"

How do I know that iam in spirituality?
And you said there is a huge difference between running away and detaching away

At present iam 20 in a year or two I have to find a job to earn my living
How many years do I depend on my parents?

When I get a job I will in that tension
After wards Marriage
Children
Bringing up the children
old age
Diseases pains
And finally death

I don't want to get in to that trap
At present I don't have much attachments but when I get a job marriage children
I will have my wife, children, there children
Grand sons grand daughter and so many attachments
I don't want that attachments

Bcoz I don't want to waste my precious life
I was worried about leading the life in a normal way
But after reading Setuu Hanuman stories
I realised that I shouldn't waste this precious life

I don't want to get in to that routein human cycle
I want to detach away and come to setuu Hanuman bodhi and have Sadhana

I want to know how do I become eligible for sadhana
When do I become eligible for sadhana?

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Your current state of evolution is such that you would want to run back to the society within 1 month of obtaining Sanyasi robes. You need at least 6 more years in mainstream society to find yourself and your purpose. Living in mainstream society with unusual and 'far from ordinary' tag is itself a Sadhana. Don't run away from this Sadhana. Face the people who are saying mean things about you. Face the society which is out to judge you. When you do this Sadhana, you will actually realize the illusion. Right now you have only read about it and it has pierced you only upto your intellect. Let it pierce further and reach your soul.Don't worry about marriage and kids. It won't happen in next 6 years. You are safe from that trap as long as you truly intend to become a Sanyasi and Lord Hanuman is there to guide your steps.

556. How do souls in Muktisagara develop desire?

Dear sirs,

Attaining moksha requires supreme knowledge about releasing the concept of 'I' and also to be void of any desires, sorrow, pleasure, pain, etc. And attaining Moksha is the supreme goal of any soul once it understand the web of nets the mortal world is. And once the souls attain Moksha (leaving the karma and desires and also understand that there is no 'I'); they enter Muktisagara.

Once they are in Muktisagara, please enlighten me on the different reasons why souls leave them - as i understand there could be 2 reasons:

1. Illusion of Brahmaloka being so powerful pulls the souls out of Muktisagara
2. Souls developing desire

My questions are:

1. Are there any other reasons for souls to leave muktisagara?
2. How does a soul develop desire Muktisagara since it will get all that it needs within Muktisagara itself?
3. What happens to a soul without any desire being pulled out of Muktisagara due to the illusion power of Brahmaloka? does it go back into Muktisagara?

I find the chapters peeling off all my questions and providing a better understanding of the universe. I really pray to Lord Hanuman to provide me with the knowledge to attain Moksha.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

These questions are meant to be answered gradually in stages. If your mind gets satisfied right now, it won't be able to absorb further supreme knowledge. Please wait for upcoming chapters and enjoy the journey as it unfolds. Only the Guru Shri Hanuman knows when to ignite a question and when to answer it.

Blessings

557. How does Illusionary universe help us attain moksh

Jai shree Ram! Hanuman ji. I dont understand this concept of illusion. I want to know if we are also living in illusion. Isn't this real world and also want to know how we can attain moksh by bypassing this illusionary universe. Please help me understand hanuman dada

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

You have to experience the supreme truth yourself. Anybody else may guide you or inspire you to take the journey of the supreme truth but the journey has to be undertaken by you and only you.

558. How does Lord Hanuman look?

Dear Setuu,

None of us have ever seen Lord Hanuman except in images and idols.
Can someone from Mathang community actually depict a sketch of Lord and post that in the subsequent chapters?

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Every word and every piece of content being posted here is posted only after taking permission from the Lord in Sakshat Hanuman Pooja. When He asks us to reveal His visible form, we will. He has not given this direction yet, most probably because visible form will be hindrance in imparting the supreme knowledge. When the world becomes eligible to see Him, you will see Him. Alternatively, you can detach from the world and come for Sadhana. If you complete Sadhana, you shall have His Sakshat Darshan.If you do not have family responsibilities and can devote at least 12 months in His service, write to us. We will guide you how to proceed.

560. How to forgive people

Pranam Guruji,

I am unable to understand few chapters,may be it will take time .guruji chapter 15th was very troubling for my mind( in true words I got scared and confused).I know its "bramagyan" so obviously aatma need some time. Chapter 16 was blissful. Guruji till now of all 16 chapters only for 2 chapters (chapter 12,16) I felt some lightness in soul but not for others,is it fine? I was in bliss or different world till chapter 13 but after this I felt lot of disturbances.

Due to rough situation in life since young age my tongue has become very bitter. I tell people whatever comes in my mind without thinking and my mind justifies my action saying that "its good as I am a straight forward person" but deep in my heart someone keeps telling that I need to change my nature.

The one person I hate in this world is my "mother in law",no matter what I do, I am UNABLE to forgive her.I have tried various methods like yoga,bhakti etc to forgive her but always FAILED in my all attempts till date.I keep bad mouthing her everywhere,friends,family,colleagues etc.I tried controlling my tongue,mind etc but no success. please suggest me something that can be understood by me.

pranam from my heart

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

For a householder, it is fine to have absorbed 2-3 chapters out of 16.

About forgiving, you must realize that you aren't doing any favor to anyone by forgiving them; instead you are doing favor to yourself. If a person is trying to harm you by any means, you must cut off from that person immediately in order to render him/her ineffective. Forgiving is a way to cut off from that person emotionally. As far as attachment is concerned, hate and love are same things. If you hate someone, you are attached to that person emotionally. And when you are attached, you can be harmed. Therefore, forgive them not for them but for yourself.

Also, practice silence. Speak to people only when it is necessary. Let your words be precious jewels. If you speak more than required, you are inviting trouble for yourself. Words spark troubles. Speak less, listen more.

561. How to get peace of mind

Jai Bajrangbali.

Nowadays, I am going through a very tough phase of life. After completing my Post Graduate, I am looking for a job and admission in PHD. It has been around five months and I haven't succeeded yet in getting a job or admission in PHD. That's why I am not getting mental peace and am very stressed. Also, sometimes I get very irritated on small things.

I am not able to concentrate on my studies and job due to absence of mental peace. Some say that I am not getting job due to some dosh in my kundali. This also makes my mind very disturbed. Truly speaking, I am really very disturbed these days.

I really want to get mental peace. I really want to relax.

Please guide me in getting peace of mind so that I get over these anxieties and concentrate on my studies and job. Please show me the path to connect to Lord Hanuman.

Thank you.

Hanumanji, please keep your blessings on me always and purify my soul and forgive my mistakes either of this birth or of previous births.

Jai Bajrangbali. Jai Shree Ram.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Read chapter 16 to Learn how Queen Kaushalya used to do it for her countrymen. Limit your experiences arising out of illusionary knowledge. Then Lord Kaaldeva will be indebted to you and will erase your sins.

There are other methods also which are explained in other chapters. For example going to ShivaLoka or forcing Indra to purge your bad desires in SwapanLoka.

563. How i came to know about Setuu?.By supreme grace of Bajrangbali on our family

It was one fine rainy sunday afternoon in april when i logged into facebook. I am not a subscriber or member of a community named Hanuman Chalisa.But somehow on my FB wall there was a photo of Lord Hanuman along with a Link to Nabharat Times. I read the Link and then from there i was redirected to Setu.. I read everthing on Setu and also the experiences people had after performing the Charan Pooja on the Nabharat Link. In no time i reserved 4 Charan Poojas ( for m Dad, Mom , elder brother and sister in law). Lord Hanuman is our KUL DEVATA( LORD OF OUR ENTIRE FAMILY INCLUDING THE ANCESORS). he is the Eastha deva of m Mom and my elder brother. My dad is his sincere devotee. By blessings of my Guru Jagadguru Shri Kripaluji Maharaj ( 5th Original Jagadguru of this world and founder of Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat known as JKP . Also known as BHAKTIYOG RASAWATAR, as his entire teaching is on NISKAAM BHAKTI , selfless devotion to the Lord. No favours , only serve the lord as his servant. Complete surrender), I also am a devotee of Lord Hanuman and visit a temple in Bhubaneswar conatining 108 idols of d Lord almost every Sat for the last 1 yr. What i meant here is thalt this is d supreme grace of the Lord dat somehow we were able to do Charanpooja and offer our Karma to Lord Hanuman,

Continued from #634, i am sorry as i myself am very concerned abt my nature. On one hand i am a sincere devotee of God and m Guru and on other side most of time m mind worries a lot abt future state of my family nd my career and life and the challlenges in life and how i can overcome them owing to my limited capabilties. It all stems from a negative thinking and lack of self confodence which i am culprit of allowig to grow in my mind.
The message i received from d Mathangs.. i took it this way. The tree symbolises the path of Bhakti (selfless devotion) as ordered by Guru. And the feet resembles faith in d lord (which i strongly lack) . In fact my devotion to lord stems mostly out of fear of the future and worry. So i pray Lord Hanuman to nless me with devotion and smaran of my guru and strong faith, shraddha in my Guru and myself (self confidence) and my capabilities. And take every situation in my life as a blessing of my Guru and Lord.Pls carry my prayers to d Lord.

564. how to ignore senses?

I am reading all chapters very carefully when they uploaded to site.

I am quite glad that i got knowledge to fly out your soul from this body and enter in other available bodies.

For that one must stop to react on senses, so brain get disconnected from senses and connects to soul (might be).

I have tried to do so, it might be happening to for a fraction of seconds but not more than that.

Could you suggest me simpler way to control senses or ignore senses.

Let the experiences flow through senses, do not try to stop the experiences. Let them flow.

565. How long before I can be one with you

Lord, As I understand you sent me here for a purpose or maybe I was being very stubborn to come here. Either ways, it's the end of my patience and I can bear no more suffering by being here any longer. I am really sorry and want to come back. How long before I can be one with you? Please give me a date so I can count down and wait for it. Its becoming very difficult to stay in this darkness.

Escapism is not same as liberation. When you try to escape from situations in life, you will land up in next birth with more complex situations. Supreme knowledge is the answer. Get knowledge and enlighten your soul.

566. How many years of Sadhana will it take to become rishi?

Pranam Mathangs and Setuu masters

In chapter 18 it is said that
Just solve the kamdhenu puzzle
And know what is kamdhenu ?
You can become rishi
"Being rishi is being in heaven is being in heaven because a rishi can fulfill any desire without doing any Purushartha "

That means rishi can doing anything

If you solve this puzzle you will get all the powers which all Rishis have and become rishi

But being in this material world
It is very difficult to find an solution with the limited human minds
And it is said in 18 th chapter
Don't be trapped by your mind go beyond it

So it is very difficult to find the answer with the normal human brains

My question is if i come to setuu Hanuman bodhi
And have Sadhana
How many years will it take to solve puzzle and become rishi ?

Iam asked with my normal human mind
Iam sorry if am I asked anything wrong

Waiting for your reply

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Within 6 months of Sadhana, you will drop the idea of 'becoming' anything. Most souls choose to depart from this mortal world (for Moksha) once the realization happens. That means, your soul will depart from your body and it will be replaced by a 'visitor soul' from Vishnu Loka. That soul may choose to become a Rishi to complete the tasks assigned to it by Lord Vishnu.

567. How to "minimise OR get rid of" these infiltration act of Asurahs

"Pl reply in hindi"
After reading all 7 chapters it is quite clear, although we normal human being
> can not see those asurahs who are infiltrating in our body and do all wrong behavior by taking control of "Body / Vivek / Samskar", now having known these facts how to prevent these?
> Since in our daily family life some times "myself or my wife or other family members" makes inappropriate behavior and started blaming each other for our wrong doing, this further disturb our peace of mind.
> Do we have any way to "get rid of" OR "minimize this effect" by safeguarding our "Culture / Vivek / Body" from infiltration of these asurahs?
> I hope, answer to above question, will blessed us with some source of energy for a normal human being

Setu Speaks: 
आपके प्रश्नों का उत्तर 7 वें अध्याय में निहित है | एक कलियुग के मनुष्य को एक नहीं बहुत सारे असुर जकड़े रहते हैं अर्थात मन - तन को जकड़कर उनके माध्यम से कोई बुरा कार्य करने की ताक में रहते हैं |

उदाहरण के तौर पर मान लीजिये किसी मनुष्य ने पहली बार शराब पी | अर्थात कोई असुर उसकी देह और विवेक पर कब्ज़ा करके उससे शराब पिलवाने में सफल हो गया | अब वह असुर ओर उसके भाई बंधू उस देह और विवेक को निशाना बना लेंगे और शराब की तलब लगायेंगे | वह इंसान शराब के साथ साथ अन्य कई बुरे कार्यों में लग जायेगा क्योंकि असुर अंतत उसके संस्कारों पर कब्ज़ा कर लेंगे | अगर वह मनुष्य पहली बार शराब पीने के तुरंत बाद अपने संस्कारों को जगा लेगा और यह चेतना जगा लेगा कि किसी असुर ने उससे गलत कार्य करवाया है और उस असुर के अगले 1 - 2 प्रयासों को अपनी चेतना और संस्कारों से विफल कर देगा तो वह असुर अपने आप भाग जाएगा | वह उसके आस पास नहीं मंडराएगा |

अगर आपके परिवार के कुछ लोगों को असुरों ने संक्रमित कर दिया है तो कम से कम आप संक्रमित न हो और हाँ जब उन पर असुर सवार हों तब उन्हें संस्कारों का पाठ पढ़ाने की कोशिश न करें | असुर अच्छे कार्यों से दूर भागते हैं | अगर आप गुस्सा करके कोई गलत कदम उठाएंगे तो समझ लीजिये असुरों ने आपको भी संक्रमित कर दिया | अगर आप अपने विवेक से अच्छा कार्य उनके आस पास करेंगे तो असुर कुछ पल के लिए दूर भाग जायेंगे और उन कुछ पलों में उनके संस्कार जाग जाये तो वे असुर फिर नहीं कब्ज़ा जमा पायेंगे |

568. how to overcome barriers

Thank you so much for everything.thank you for accepting my prayers. i can feel the difference. sri anjaneyaya namah.

i have a feeling there are two persons in me.or three perhaps? as i write or when i speak to myself, i'm both speaking and listening. one seems to be constant or unchanging and speaks very rarely or watches everything. and, the other is always active and confusing. i feel i need to overcome the latter. how do i do that? or, if i'm wrong, how do i overcome the confusion? everything seems to be affecting the latter as well. if i'm a soul, which one is it? who bears the karma? who dies? are all the souls connected? for instance, aren't my children's souls connected to me? whether i understand all that or not, i want to be with god all the time. anjaneya, give me bhakthi and save me.be with me all the time.please remove all the dirt accumulated over the years. i am doing my japam etc. still i remain impure.i'm sure i must have done a lot of paapams in my previous as well as presnt births intentionlly and unintentionally. i repent now. what should i do to be forgiven? i need a lot of strength and blessings to overcome all the hurdles. help me. give me and my family sadbudhi. give me bhakthi. sri gurubhyo namah. sri anjaneyaya namah. sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram. my namaskars to you. my namaskars to the sarangs and Setuu masters as well .

Setu Speaks: 
Divine soul,

If "you" feel that there are two persons in "you", then total how many persons are there?

Suppose there is a room and in that room, you can see two persons, then how many total persons are there in the room? 2+1=3

Similarly if you can see three persons in the room, total how many persons are there? 3+1=4

With the grace of God, you are on the right path. There is no "final" answer to this question because this question will take you to God. There is no stopping. If you have got an answer, that means you have given up the journey in the middle.

Keep watching "you". This "you" will make you observe 2, then 3, then 4 .... and then finally you will have Darshan of God.

Do not confuse yourself with the concepts of Karma and Soul. You might have heard many things about "Karma" and "Soul" from your childhood. Do not confuse yourself with those contradictory thoughts heard from here and there. Just do the Japa and keep observing "you"! You are on the right path. When you see God, you will have a clear understanding of "Karma" and "Soul". You won't need to rely on books when you have the first hand experience of seeing God.

"continued from #10056"

so happy i got a reply. am i accepted as a sishya of sri hanuman?! what more can i expect?am i worthy of it? i certainly want to go beyond the barriers and find the real self to reach rama. i've heard a guru recognizes his sishya and there is a special bond. will i experience that? to attain moksha. I have experienced many difficulties.i thought i won't be even able to get up. i had given up myself. but i also have been helped with a lot of kindness from ishwara. i've been protected as well. i've often felt that may be these difficuties are my guru's way of making me think.i have felt at one point in life that i was not anybody's slave and that god is the only truth but how to reach that? how to cross the barrier? anyway this is all i can. i need help for that great realization and blessings from my guru. i want to be blessed by hanuman. i want to be forgiven for my sins. i want to lead a fruitful life of peace and happiness so that i can also help the people around me. i want to reach god and not get stuck with all the hurts.i was very different. then when i saw problems around my people, i thought it's not worth it in life if i don't help. that was the beginning leading me into the world of maya. now so much of dirt has filled me that i can't purify without the guru's help. i also want to know why my brother too is going through a similar situation. how will i know hanuman closely? i have also felt that this is not what i want and that i have to leave. at the same time all my attacments pull me down.i need a lot of strength, wisdom and proper guidance from my guru who is still not visible to me. i also want my husband to join me in this path of spiritual wellbeing and realization. my earnest and sincere prayers for everything, especially to go beyond the superficial self. how to overcome that barrier? waiting with prayers,namaskarams to mathangs,
thanking you for everything,
geeta
om sri anjaneyaya namah
sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,
If you have full faith in Lord Hanuman, you have the quality to be His shishya. The Mathangs' Guru is Lord Hanuman. He comes to impart the supreme knowledge; the Brahma Gnan to their new generation every 41 years. Right from the beginning of His visit to the Mathangs, until the visit end, Every incidence which happens with Mathangs and every word spoken by Lord Hanuman is only and only for the purpose of imparting the Brahma Gnan. He first dismantles the structured beliefs of His shishyas and then imparts the divine knowledge. Follow these incidences and words by reading the chapters as we post here, you will also get the Brahma Gnan. One day you will get His Darshan too. It depends on the number of barriers which are there to be unlocked. It depends on the amount of impurities to be shed. Many devotees have written to us that they saw Lord Hanuman immediately after reading first chapter. It depends how many chapters it will take to break barriers of your mind and intellect.
Attachment with family members is also a big barrier. Attachment and Love are two different things. You can love your family and still be detached from them. You have no control over life of others including your brother and husband. They have their own history of Karmas. You have your own history of Karmas. When you "want" your husband to walk with you on the path of supreme, you are actually locking yourself in one more barrier of "want". Every soul has an independent relationship with the supreme soul of Lord Hanuman. Recognize and cherish that relation and walk in faith.

Lord Hanuman said in chapter 5 that

There are millions of devotees who want to have my Sakshat Darshan but they fail to get over their bodily desires. The most they do in their life is to utilize their body and mind to their full potential. They fail to even touch the potential of their souls. You have to realize and utilize potential of your soul.

You can start by not shooting questions from top of your mind. Let the questions pierce your being and reach to the deep most level. Do not yearn for easy and ready-made answers. Let your queries create an unbearable anguish. Let your questions bore deep into the layers of illusions which are covering your soul.

Seeking supreme knowledge is not like sitting in a school or college exam. Do not post questions until they drill your being. There are 20 chapters deciphered now. There is plenty of knowledge to ponder upon. Bathe in that knowledge. An answer you get by yourself will be worth more than a thousand ready-made answers you tend to seek.

Blessings

573. how to remember all bad karma of life

jai shree hanuman
jaisa ki maine abhi padha ki ganga mata ke paas jaakar apne puraney sabhi karmo ko yaad karna chahiye aur ganga mata ko batana chahiye. Main yeh jaanna chahata hunn ki agar uss samay usse apne sabhi bure karma yaad nahin aayey. keval kuch hee yaad aaye toh kya hoga?

Setu Speaks: 
दिव्य आत्मस्वरूप ,

यहाँ पर गंगा माता के पास जाने का अर्थ उनकी देह अर्थात गंगा नदी के पास जाना नहीं है | इसका अर्थ है अपनी आत्मा को उनकी आत्मा के पास ले जाना |

जैसे आप किसी ऑफिस में जाते है तो अपना ID कार्ड गेट पर दिखाते हैं वैसे ही जब आपकी आत्मा गंगा जी के पास जाती है तो अपना परिचय देने के लिए अपने बुरे कर्म दिखाती है | जब आप गंगा जी के ध्यान में होंगे तब आपके दिमाग को उनके साथ हुए वार्तालाप का आभास तक नहीं होगा | आपकी आत्मा वार्तालाप करेगी |

574. How to rise above mind-2

"Continued from #443626"

Thank you Setuu for the reply.

After going through all the chapters posted so far, I have got many things except "How to rise above mind". I have already made Lord Hanuman my guru and seeking knowledge(Brahm Gyan) from him through his Leela's. Now, how can I leave the path of seeking as told by you? I didn't get just one thing. Should I leave the path of seeking just for not understanding one thing?

You told me to remain on the path of devotion and surrender fully to the Lord. Here, I want to tell you that I am always on the path of devotion and have surrendered myself fully to Lord Hanuman. I don't know where I am exactly right now. I must say right now I have the feeling of suffering and joy. But it doesn't bother me much. I think whatever happens to me it's the will of Lord Hanuman and my karma of this birth and previous births are responsible for it. I have the feeling that Hanumanji is there to help me and when Hanumanji is with me nothing bad can happen to me. I don't know whether I am moving towards "Samras" or not.

Please help me and show me the right direction.

Please forgive me if I said anything wrong. I just wrote my views.

Thank you Setuu
Thank you Mathangs
Regards

Jai Hanuman
Jai Shree Ram

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

There are two ways to reach God- (1) Knowledge (2) Devotion

If knowledge doesn't suit, one should go for devotion. Devotion towards God is different than commitment towards a Guru. In devotion, you will see God in everything and every phenomena.

After reading 5 chapters, all confusions will not settle but the level of question should certainly rise. Instead of asking "How should I rise above mind", you should give your point of view and elaborate it with examples of your life. Then only you are on the path of seeking knowledge.

Blessings

575. How to rise above mind-3

"Continued from 486328"

Thank you Setuu for the reply. But I didn't get all my answers and doubts cleared from your reply.

Let me ask you few questions. As you said there are two ways to reach God - Knowledge and Devotion. Do I need to follow only one out or two to reach God? Can't I follow both Knowledge and Devotion both to reach God. I am seeking knowledge from the leelas of lord Hanuman and as far as devotion is concerned, I am fully devoted to lord Hanuman. I have full faith in Hanumanji. Thus, I am following both the paths. Is it wrong?

Now comes how should I rise above mind. Truly speaking, here I am not very clear. I tried to get answer from your previous reply but I couldn't get much. You told to observe mind, observe intellect, observe the observer. I really didn't understand what actually to do. You also told that the peaceful region is above mind. So, I tried to move over there. But I am not able to reach that peaceful region fully. More I try to obstruct the thoughts, more potential they acquire.

I am not able to think peacefully on anything. So many thoughts come to my mind at the same time. There come positive thoughts too but most of the times there are negative thoughts. For example, let us suppose I am holding something in my hand. Then, a thought will come to my mind what if it falls from my hand. Let us take another example. Suppose someone or I am going to catch a train for some important work, then also it does come to my mind what if someone or I miss the train. What if someone or I meet with an accident? Even when I am doing Pooja, evil thoughts come to my mind. I try to ignore them. But again after sometime they come to my mind. I am not even able to do even pooja peacefully. There are numerous such examples.

Although so many negative thoughts come to mind but I never do anything negative. I always do what is right. That's why I really want to know why these negative thoughts come to my mind when I never do anything negative or wrong.

I really want my mind to be free from negative thoughts. I really want to concentrate on my aim without any deviation. I want my thoughts to be pure and positive.

Please show me the way. Please guide me. I really need your help.

Jai Bajrangbali. Jai Shree Ram.

Thank you Setuu. Thank you Mathangs.

Regards.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

If you have read 7th chapter, you must have got the answer why evil thoughts come in your mind. It is because of Asurrahs who linger around your body. That is a result of many past Karmas. It will take time to purge all those Karmas. Sure way to get rid of Asurrahs one by one is DENIAL. Whenever an evil thought comes, deny the Asurrahs pleasure of experiencing fear through your body-mind. That means, resist the fear. You will get rid of them one by one.

576. How should I practice the concept of "I am paramatma"?

Continued from 531907
Pranam on lord Hanuman's holy feet

Should I imagine the concept in this way " I am paramatma and all other living and non living things and the whole universe are my reflection .The person /animal/non-living thing infront of me is paramatma and I am his/her reflection."

But another person /animal/good and bad people/ universe(stars ,planets ,galaxies)are so different from me. Is this due to very high variation of my reflection?

Which is the mirror? Where is this mirror ?(in another belt of time?/ Is my body the mirror?) .Is it a typical mirror or any other thing that is called as mirror?

After I had read chapter 23 i am trying to practice this concept. It is helping me in this way---- whenever I become angry on someone or don't like their behaviour i think that "I am paramatma and he /she is my reflection" and I get relief from anger or just like the way he/she treated with me .
Is it right way practising the concept? If not then please show me the path.

Whatever enlightenment/supreme knowledge we achieve in each birth,does it get stored? Like suppose there are 100 types of supreme knowledge. Let i have achieve 5 types in one birth .so in next birth will these 5 types will get stored and I can achieve other types except these 5 types OR i have to achieve again these 5 types and then continue?

NOW THESE QUESTIONS ARE IRRITATING MY MIND(this happens to all of us when unable to find answers of our questions)
PLEASE SIR GIVE REPLY (if possible soon) TO MY QUESTIONS

PLEASE FORGIVE MY IGNORANCE.
PRANAM

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

"I am Paramatma and my body as well as bodies of people around me are my reflections." This is correct.

Lord Ram encountered a lion and thought that how could lion be my reflection. Yes, the lion is very high variation of my reflection.

If you can find a mirror, that mirror is also the reflection of Paramatma. That is not the mirror where Paramatma is reflected. That mirror is just another reflection.

Your thoughts about '100 types of knowledge' are in wrong direction. Think this way: Suppose there is a monk who has attained all types of knowledge you could possibly think, why can't your soul enter into the body of that monk?

Blessings

577. How Soul chosses which body to pursue?

My query is how soul chooses in which body to pursue his/ her journey?
It do not always choose a healthy body otherwise there will be no persons with special abilities?

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

If you have read the chapters sincerely, you must have read that the soul travels in the coordinates of desire and Karma just like body travels in coordinates of Time-Space. At any point, what is the Karma and Desire coordinate of soul, determines the body and the experiences of the soul.

Blessings

578. How to stay away or get awareness of surrah and assurah?

Gratitude setuu..
lord guru hanuman ji ko koti koti pranam...

I have confusion about my body regarding who is controlling myself..

If i am on back seat who is driving myself .
Who is making desires, is it my soul or surrah and if one of them is responsible for it then how ?

If i have desire who is filfulling it ?

How to distinguish between my soul or surrah or assurah?

If i want to myself away from surrah or assurah , what is the procedure?

If i do not make any desire just eat drink or sleep other personal work ,are these desire mine (soul)or surrah or assurah ??

bless my soul and remove confusion .

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

If you are vulnerable to the trap of space-time, you are vulnerable to Surrahs-Asurrahs. If you are aware that space-time is playing an illusion before you, then Surrahs-Asurrahs cannot affect you. This awareness comes from supreme knowledge.

Sometime Sanskaras also may help in recognizing Surrahs-Asurrahs. But that is not the fool-proof way. When you do something, think whether what you have done is as per your Sanskaras. If you have done something which is not in your Sanskara, then some Asurrah or Surrah has influenced your action. But if a Asurrah or Surrah takes over your Sanskara, then this method won't work. You are a "good" soul. Therefore your Sanskara is not captured by any Asurrah. It may be under influence of Surrahs though. So, you can recognize Asurrahs but you may not recognize Surrahs. Higher knowledge is the only fool-proof way.

579. how will the state of Moksha be in real life

can anybody explain the state of moksha, just to say wil l i still be I or will i achieve one all -where in i really cant experience anything, is not experiencing anything moksha, if so will there be separate energy entity for it or how is it

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Moksha is not a state, neither is it state-less-ness. It is when you completely melt your identity and merge with the whole. When you are not there, how can there be a state? Think on these lines and you will realize the truth.

580. A hug through Vayu by my dearest Vayu Putra

I am a devotee of Lord Hanuman. Right from my Childhood I have been in love with my LORD. Near my house is a popular hanuman temple on a mountain. Once during one of my visits when i stepped in, I saw the lord beautifully decorated. I closed my hands in avahan mudra and prayed.. Lord you were lucky to hug your Rama. When will i be lucky to get a hug from you? Just then a strong breeze engulfed me from front as though it came right from the idol inside. There are no windows or entrances in front. But where did this wind come from? I felt as though the Lord heard my prayer and he in the form of Vayu he himself came and hugged me. It may sound silly for many... but for me it was my Lords way of responding to my prayer. Another experience, Last week when i was sick my body woud shiver uncontrollably in the middle of the night. I would just recollect Lord Hanuman's face and start chanting Ram...within 3 times of chanting my shivering would stop. What Love of my LORD!
JAi Sri Ram!

584. Human Form

Thank you so much for my earlier question.I need to know some more.Is soul receive human form after doing some good deeds.and what was my earlier birth.Presently I'm not married and even after so much effort unable to find someone due to this there is so much of tension in my family.please tell me and suggest me the suitable path.
Thank you

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Experiences of past are a baggage too heavy that it has shadowed the real you. It has changed your perspective of this world completely. Rebuild your self esteem and rediscover the beauty in the world. Meanwhile Lord Hanuman is working with Lord Indra to fulfill your desires.

Blessings


585. Humble gratitude for this living master

I am offering my humble prayers to lord hanuman since long time and is graced by his presence always. His blessed prayers have powers of manifesting anything materialistic and non materialistic. His mere recitation of name can do severe miracles even in worldly matters. I wish to be with hanuman grace all the time. I wish lord hanuman gives us strength and wisdom to overcome all odds in all the births.

Query to Mathangs:

Will I get salvation with grace of lord hanuman in this birth? Also what are the plans for lord hanuman for people having religion Hinduism who used to perform tough austerities. How feasible can it be for worldly persons to get salvation while living worldly life?

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Sometimes worldly life can become a boon for the soul. Only the first spark is needed in householder's life. Unfortunately they get that first spark only when some bad things happen in their life. Once the spark is there and he/she starts questioning the existence, then it doesn't matter whether one is in worldly life or not. Worldly life can also become Sadhana. You only need to realize that you are not a body. You are a soul. Then let the body do worldly things. You can remain detached from those activities. You can remain detached from things done by your body and thoughts flowing in your mind. Once you reach that stage, you can have Sakshat Darshan of Lord Hanuman. He will guide you further.

Blessings


586. hurt

how to overcome hurt? how to become pure? how to reach god? i have some barrier. please help me overcome. i've lost all the goodness and love. please help me. how to help my husband and children?please guide me.sriram jairam jai jai ram om sri anjaneyaya namah.
how to, most importantly, forgive and forget, when people have hurt me badly? how to help my brother?

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Congratulations for realizing the barrier. Majority of human beings live with barriers for their entire life but you have at least realized it. So the "hurt" has done its work. Now it is up to you if you want a patch to cover your hurt and then go back to your normal life. Or you want to smile over the hurt and try to find "Who is Really Hurt?". It is not you who is hurt. You are a divine soul, how come you be hurt? It is actually a "superficial self" which is hurt. Majority of people live with this superficial self. You are on the verge of identifying this superficial self and then the journey starts. To reach God, make Lord Hanuman your Guru. Lord Hanuman comes to Mathangs to tell them the way to reach Ram. If you follow this conversation, you will definitely reach God. Read the chapters of this conversation between Mathangs and Lord Hanuman as we post them. Second chapter will be posted shortly.

Blessings


587. I am better than before

I had very bad times in past but by the grace of lord i am now in better situations. I am really heartliy thankful to my helping hands. I do not know but i am bold with postivity around me. I am sure lord Hanuman dada is only one who was with me in my bad times. But please do not leave me. I want your warmth and protection from sins. Also i want you to magically separate me from my body. And take me to supreme happiness of abode of supreme lord.i had experienced that truth and joy.yes there was only joy and light and i do not know what was that. But it was only joy.no sorrow only joy. I was not in my body. I do not know. I want to enjoy freedom. I want to fly like that experience. What was that? How can i explain in words? It was only light.light and light.

588. i am bit confused regarding my dreams

!!Jai Shri Ram!!
!!Jai hanuman ji!!

Respected setuu masters

Kindly guide me as i am bit confused regarding my dreams.i am frequently dreaming of hanuman ji,and two days before i had dream in which there was a saint organising for some kind of pooja,and somebody was chanting "jai shri ram".when the person chanting "jai shri ram",my soul was experiencing strange feeling,i was feeling like my soul was flying out of my body.The person was chanting "jai shri ram" was not clearly visible to me but i was sure in my dream that he was my guru hanuman ji.The dream was like real but it was a dream.my mind is not able to bear such dreams.Plz settle my mind with your divine words.ll

"Jai shri ram".

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

We advise devotees not to try to do postmortem of dreams. If it is a good dream and you do postmortem, you may waste an opportunity to realize that dream in real world. If it is a bad dream and you do postmortem of it, you recycle your bad desires which may result in a bad reality next time.

Do not try to understand dreams. Just let them be,

Blessings


589. I am confused.

I love Lord and His devotees. I was under the umbrella of The Lord in my childhood and since I stooped to a prey to my "Vasanas" I lost the grace of The Lord. Now my life is so lost and I want to come back to the loving abode of the Grace of The Lord. I know I have some divine mysteries associated with my past birth. I also love my parents and I feel that there is some divinity and some secret associated with them.
How do I find the answers to my questions and what should I do now. I tried to leave this world, I am not able to leave it. I want to know how should I live in this world as per the guidance of Lord Vishnu and how can I surrender to His devotees.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Read the chapters of Lord Hanuman's Leelas. There is no need to leave your world.

590. I am interested and I want to meet the hanumanji saxat

I visited your site. Reference of internet surfing. In fact, I am great believer of hindu traditions, religion and lords. I am really impressed by your site. I just created my account to read the adhyays which are said by the lord hanumanji to the matangs. I just completed first adhyay. But I am confused that what I do next ?. How can I give my arpan . And whrn and how I can meet the hanumanji.. please guide me.please reply me in between next 108 hours. I am very very very much interested to meet the hanumanji saxat.
It is my humble request to you...

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Arpanam can be done in any Hanuman temple where Vaanars are present. Fruits Arpanam is preferred.

To have Sakshat Darshan of Lord Hanuman, you have two options :

(1) Come to Setuu Hanuman Bodhi and do Sadhana under guidance of Setuu Masters. You need to be free from worldly responsibilities and you need to devote at least 1 year for Sadhana initially (Depending on how evolved you are, spiritually). If you want to do Sadhana, write about yourself in detail. Write about your family, your soul's history of relationship with Lord Hanuman and any experience/dream you had recently where you saw Lord Hanuman. Tell about that dream/experience in detail. Also tell about the knowledge you acquired by reading chapters of Lord Hanuman's Leelas posted here so that Setuu masters can get an impression of your soul.

(2) Or you can duly read the Leelas of Lord Hanuman being posted here. You will get the 36 line long Mantra when all the chapters are posted here and read by you. By reciting that Mantra, a devotee can have Sakshat Darshan of Lord Hanuman.

Blessings

594. I am very eager to know the birth of lord Vishnu's Next Avatar

Hi,
Please let me know when will you decipher chapter that details about Kalki Avtar. I am really exicted to know vishnu's next avatar. These days I have strong feeling that kaliyug is nearing the end. Since i can't see people suffer for more years with injustice or corruption or murder of inncoents or droughts or no much rain earlier, I pray vishnu god to come soon to the earth.

one more question, whenver I talk about hindu gods and tradition, practises,belifes. Many others have commented that why other religion in the world do not have all these? for example diffrent avatar of vishnu, or why vishnu avatar is happening only in India? why not UK or US or Japan? Vishnu is only for Hundus? not for other religion people in the world?

Kindly answer my query, pls atleast let me know vishnu has already taken a birth or yet to take a birth? how many more years to end thi kaliyug?

Thanks in advance,
Raghu

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

We cannot speculate. There are signs and hints in the chapters of Lord Hanuman's Leelas. As soon as we confirm, we will publicly post the details. This world is already full of confusions and speculations. We do not want to contribute to the confusion. We will only publish the definite details as soon as we get them. Right now we cannot tell when we will get them.

Lord Vishnu is not India specific. It is not necessary that He takes birth in Asia. He can take birth in Europe or any other continent also.

595. i believe in god.

Some peoples in this world dont belive in god. They stic to the science. But beyond science there is some power. 18 years back i was in such physical condition and i couldnt get proper medicine. According to science nothing was wrong with me. But i was feeling something odd. Only strong devotees of sree hanuman, sree gurudev datta and some saints without toching me told me the truth. There was no way out. I was still trying. I must have commited lot of sin.

When god blesses u.you get started proper medicines to come out any disease. This is applicable to any situation to come out in the life.


596. I BELIEVE HANUMAN JI

MY HUSBAND WAS IN DEATH BED IN 2006 DUE TO AN ROAD ACCIDENT AND I WAS PREGNANT . HE WENT TO COMMA . DOCTOR GAVE 72 HRS AND THAT TIME MY MAIN MANTRA WAS JAI HANUMAN GAYAN GUN SAGAR------------DAY AND NIGHT I PRAYED AND AFTER 48 HRS MIRACLES HAPPENED. HE GOT BACK TO SENSE SLOWLY.I THINK GOD'S POWER IS TO BE REALIZED BY ALL. AND HAS TO BE APPRECIATED THROUGH OUT. I BELIEVE HIM A LOT. FOR ANY CRISIS HE HELPS ME NOW ALSO ALTHE TIME WHEN EVER I RECALL HIM. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT HIS PRESENCE IS EVERY WHERE., JAI HANUMANJI

597. I don't know

I don't know whether a layer of ignorance and dirt has been removed or not. I do want to make an arpanam. i'll describe what I felt. After reading the chapter, for a while I was thoughtful. Then I sang a bhajan and felt like crying. Then I had my bath and did puja, offering flowers. Tomorrow I'll be going to Hanuman temple for a puja and want to offer fruits. in my mind I offered fruits to a monkey who comes here sometimes. A banana and apples. This was my experience immediately after reading the chapter. While doing my regular puja, I meditated on Sri Hanuman and Sriram and offered flowers to Shiva, Vishnu and Devi as well. i need further guidance. Om Namah Shivaya. Jai SriRam, Jai Anjaneya!

Then I had a doubt. As a mother I want my children to lead a good life. I should be able to provide what they need for education etc. Is that an unfair wish or a desire? I don't think I can avoid that. I have to be with them as a support, I feel. is that wrong? sriram Jairam Jaijairam. Pranams to all there. Prostrations to Hanuman.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

That is not an unfair desire. You should fulfill your duties and family responsibilities with a sense of detachment. When detachment appears, pure love evolves.

598. I dont know why but i dont feel something tumbling out of me when i read chapters

Jai shree ram! I want to know why i dont feel lighter after reading chapters. I feel i have gained knowledge. Is thinking that i have gained knowledge wrong. Why dont i feel lighter. Please help me get an answer to it hanuman dada. Happy birthday dada

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Suppose you have fallen into a deep well. People who are trying to get you out of the well send two things down - (1) Some food and water so that you can get energy (2) A rope. Rope is supposed to take you out of the well. But you keep both food and rope inside and say, "I am happy. I have got food to eat. I want to stay in the well itself."

This is what we are. We are fallen into a well called mind. The supreme knowledge sends you something to feed the mind and a rope to take you out of the boundaries of mind. Being a householder living in a mainstream society, it is understandable that you are finding it difficult to transcend your mind.

You should have an urge to reach to the supreme truth. You should not be comfortable in the boundaries of time. Then only this supreme knowledge will bring you on the path of Moksha.

Blessings


599. i have a mixed state of mind.

jai hanuman before i start anything.

i want to know it from mathangs that why is that i always remember the bad in people and not the good they have done. whenever i meet a person for the first time i feel so glad about them and later as time passes i always feel more negatives about them and not positive. i am selfish at some things like i dont want anyone to get above me in my career but i have a very humble heart towards animals and people suffering. when i see a animal suffering i cant tolerate and also when i see a child or a old person begging and being ignored by people i just get angry and will try helping them. why is that i am in a mixed state? how can i cure my soul from selfishness and other evil. And one more thing is my mind never sticks to one things. when i love some work and start doing it and suddenly change my interest to something else and will go for it leaving the old one and due to this i am unable to gain full knowledge in anything. can you tell me what exactly is happening with me. but while reading chapters my bold really went cold and my heart beat rose at certain levels of the story. please answer and suggest me what best i can do. thankyou very much Setuu for connecting people with the almighty anjeneya swamy. and if you could personally forward my blessings to lord anjeneya through mathans i have a small request, my father fells ill frequently and he is been facing problems in the matter of health as well as money. he has struggled a lot in his life so far i want to see him happy from now onwards. this one wish of mine is not being addressed by god dont know for what reason. he has been with me in all my tough times and gave me lot of success but i pray lord hanuman to bless my dad and mom with lot of happiness through out their life.

my humble request is kindly answer my questions. thankyou jai sri ram jai hanuman

This stream of thoughts were taken up in Sakshat Hanuman Pooja of 1st November 2014, Saturday.

Every person has his/her own nature. Instead of feeling guilty about your nature, you should realize that you are unique in this world. Your behavior is alright as long as you are aware of what you are doing. Awareness is most crucial thing which you already have. You should come out of guilty consciousness.

Instead of getting influenced from everything you come across, you should define a set of rule to live life. and then you should live life according to those rules.

For example, suppose your rule is- "I will live my life to achieve goals defined by me time to time. If need be, I would change myself in order to be eligible person to achieve those goals. If situation demands, I will change my goals."

Then suppose a situation comes when you do not see any way forward. At the end, you have to change your way. At that juncture, you cannot sit and think- "oh, I am changing my way. See, how weak a person I am."

Instead you should think- "It is within the set of rules of my life that if a roadblock comes, and no way is left, I will change my way. Hence I am not weak. I am living my life as per my rules and this change of way is within those rules."

601. i have scored good marks in my online examination

i have scored good marks in hardware and networking course before a day of examination i have chanted lord rama's name and chanted hanuman chalisa 11 times and bajrang baan 6 times and after next day i gone to give my online examination i score very easily good marks that is my only experience of this

602. I Love Rama Baktha Hanuman Ji Jai Shree Rama Rama

I felt the divine purpose of that story and my illusion is so strong I only pray lord hanuman to destroy my illusion and give me Moksha

603. I met two hanumanaji in dream. Small hanumanaji and big hanumanaji at a one time in Dream. If sadhak feels to roam in swargloak vishnuloak patalloak in deep medition then what is true.Is sadhak really visits to that loka or just is it imagination.

scientist proved and says our brain is responcible for creation of dream.out of body experiance. Ghost .loklokantar swarg patal loak parallel universe are created by our brain. I have asked you that if our brain creates dream word and out of body experiances to roam in swarg and patalloak then how ones soul can go to swarglok patalloak .is it our just imagination of brain or true condition .I met two hanumanaji at a one time in dream .Is it just imagination of my brain during dream and sleep or is it true.please tell me what is true. In deep medition sadhak feels that he is leaving body and going to roam vishnuloaka patalloaka .then what is true acording to science that stages are created by our midbrain imagination cells.means that word is not exists just it is brain imaginations.some psychitik patients feels another word due to chemical imbalance of brain.if some person has taken higher druas then he has also feeling of that word is moving around him.he may see ten faces of frontstanding man duetobrain.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

There are two separate things : (1) The experience (2) Explanation of the experience.

Explanation is sought by mind while experience by the soul. Your soul experiences other worlds and then your mind tries to explain it in its limits. If a write goes to visit Paris and write about his experience in a book, it does not mean that Paris exists only in that book. It means that he has gone to Paris and written the experience in book. Similarly, your mind can found a thousand ways to describe the experiences of soul. Don't dwell in explanations, go for experiences.

604. I need clarity in life

Jai Shree Ram.
I have been divorced for almost 2 years now. I had agree for divorce due to certain issues though internally I never wanted to separate from my husband whom I dearly love till this moment. No second in the day passes when I dont think about him or miss him. The memories haunt me badly. Though it has been more than 2 years since everything ended and we have not been in contact but something inside me still says that we are meant to be together and one day we will reunite. What should I perceive from this inner voice? My family is after me to marry again but I can't. My mind and soul dont permit for the same. I can't think of anyone in place of my ex husband. Please help me.

Setu Speaks: 
Have you read Chapter 2 of Immortal Talks- Book 1? It tells about the mathematics of Karma.

If this attachment to your ex-husband is one-sided, you are doing immense harm to yourself and your family. Every soul has bad Karma and because of one-sided attachment you are taking on your husband's Karma on yourself thereby creating more and more suffering for yourself.

So, if it is a one-sided attachment, earlier you let go of him, is better. Marry again only and only when you've let go of this one-sided attachment otherwise the new companion and his family will also suffer due to this one-sided attachment.

605. I need help !

Due to my foolish behaviour, I am in trouble. I need urgent help from Hanumanji !
I know that he knows my weakness and mistakes all along, which warned me time and again, but I did not understand and have done a huge mistake.

I am reading Shiv Raksha Stotra every day, as much as I can.

Am I on the right path ? Please request Mahabali Hanumanji to guide me.

I am sure he is my saviour and Guru !

with sashtang pranams,

your bhakta & desciple,

Smita

606. I never believed on god

I exprience lot of negative things in human world that i stop believings on god. That they exist in this cruel world where human for his all selfisness can do anything. Since i m a girl, everyone treating me with different percepective. No one asked my dreams.,my happiness but everyone decide it on my behalf. Partiality always keep me questioning on my mind why god made that type of world where boys can do any good or bad thing bt no one blame bt if girl step out from her home every one questioning on her character.my heart is always true with myself nd i think same good thing with nearby people. But whenever i intract with someone people never want to intract with my soul and heart bt they want my body.
But now after reading all the chapters i start beliving on god. I can now understand whatever god give us a exprience to learn on different kind of illusion that we always think a real kind bt actually thats a illusion. After reading all the chapters lot of answer i get which i always wanted.

607. I really want to meet lord hanumandada

Once i meet lord hanuman dada i will ask him what to do in life. Right now i am thinking as lord rama is archetype. As he obeyed his parents i also do. I go to office and do dinural actovoties. But after i meet lord hanumandada he will take me to cold mountains and will teach me meditation. I will do penance with him. Lord will enjoin me to leave sinful ways and will pious my soul like lord rama and shivaji soul. I will perform activities driven by lord hanumandada. I know i am sinful so he is not appearing in front of me.but one day i will get my sins cut by lord hanuman dada and i will also leave this body and will be freed to roam with shri bhagwan.

608. I request you to ask lord hanuman on my behalf

Pranam Setu Sant ji,

I am doing my best to follow your instructions guruji.I am trying my best to divert my mind for adoption but still I am lost. please dont get upset with
my words as I dont mean to irritate you.I am daily speaking to lord Hanuman but
unable to get any response. I have read in "query" section that "lord vishnu has given human beings capacity to change our destinyby doing "karma" is it true?.

day by day I am becoming a "LONER",is it normal? I am losing interest in friends,relative etc. Earlier I use to be a very friendly person but not now. guruji I stay at home whole day alone.I dont have any job to keep myself busy.I have already mentioned in my earlier email that for last 10 years
i have done only 2 things "struggled to get job" and than "trying to stay in job" but at last I failed,may be gods wish.Before my marriage I prayed & struggled
for education and job,after marriage for kid but got nothing at the end.I will never be praying for anything in life as i have understood one very hard thing that no matter how we pray only our karma & destiny rules.

My father is lord hanuman devotee since long time but everyone pities his life.he never complains but everyone questions his bhakti towards lord.two of his daughters are issue less (myself 1st one) & younger one still unmarried.

I saw lord hanuman in my dreams(I saw him after reading chapter 13) but unable to understand it so have come to you for advice.I am at home trying to do reading,
chanting ram nam but still feel disturbed/confused.I dont find interest in any work,people,what should I do? nowadays my health has also deteriorated in spite of doing yoga etc.blood reports are normal but I dont know where is the problem. LOrd hanuman I dont doubt your capability but even I am a common human being who can get lost.my future looks blank,will I do only eating.sleeping,idling. will this be my life than in what way I am different from animals? Please lord hanuman guide me or show me some way before i get insane.

guruji I request you to ask lord hanuman on my behalf (as elders say that god listens to everyone but he can never deny his messengers prayers & you "MA-TANGS" are his messengers) this question in "sakshat puja". He has to answer my question.

Pranam

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Prayer does help. It helps a lot. But the prayer cannot be done by the body or mind. You are a free entity. You can come to level of body, mind or stay at higher levels of Chitt and Soul. Most human beings live at the level of body and mind. When you fear about your future, worry about circumstances etc., you are at the level of body-mind. At that level, you cannot do prayer. At that level, you express only fear and lower desires. Those desires are heard by Lord Indra, not the higher Gods. If you want to communicate with Lord Hanuman or other Gods who live in the realm of soul, you have to rise to the level of soul.

There can be many ways to rise to the level of soul. Some people can rise simply by chanting 'Ram', or any other Mantra. Or you can read a chapter of Lord Hanuman's Leelas to rise to the level of soul. When you try to express at the level of soul, you never express your fear. You will just remain silent. Only words which may come out of your mouth would be 'Hey Ram' or 'Om'. You will never express your materialistic desire at that level. When your soul connects with the supreme, prayer automatically happens. And that prayer does bear materialistic fruits also. At that level the soul expresses desire of Mukti. And to fulfill that desire, Gods have to settle down your worldly conflicts first. So they work to either settle down your worldly conflicts or design them so as to give you lessons.

Also, find a higher purpose in life. Materialistic desires get fulfilled when you are not desperate for them. Let your actions be driven by the higher purpose. Your higher purpose could simply be "to find happiness in every moment'. Take it like a game. You have a puzzle of life in front of you and you have to locate happiness in there. Find reasons to be happy in every moment.

Solitude is good but not loneliness. If you have disconnected from people to avoid their reactions, that is not good. Meet people just for the sake of testing your spiritual evolution. If somebody shows pity at you, just see if it hurt you. Then rise above that hurt. Witness how you respond to people. Just imagine yourself having a basket in which you are collecting experiences. Imagine experiences as flowers. There are different kind of flowers. Keep collecting them. 'Somebody showed pity at me' (put it in the basket), Somebody jeered at me (put it in basket), Somebody talked about me behind my back (put it in basket).

You have a choice- you can either get crashed by the circumstances or use them as steps towards spiritual evolution.

609. I saw Lord Hanuman in form of a cloud.

First of all thank you setuu group for making us all know more about Lord Hanuman. And also my pranams to Mathangs.
I got Lord Hanuman's divine darshan in the form a cloud. That day was saturday and I was on my way from Gnana Saraswati Temple in Basara,Telangana to Hyderabad by train. It was evening and was feeling uneasy that I did not go to Hanuman temple that day being saturday. I was just feeling uncomfortable at that time due to this. But to my surprise wen I looked toward the sky, I could see a cloud in the form of Lord Hanuman sleeping sideways facing towards me and with his both hands between his legs. And his tail could be seen in the form of cloud. I was completely shocked to see that. But I did not understand, why did he not give darshan in the usual way i.e as if he is blessing his devotee. Why in the sleeping form. I wanted to ask this to any one who can tell me why. After that wen I went back home, my aunt how had come to visit hyd had just went to hanuman temple and got orange kumkum which is given in Hanuman temple and she applied the kumkum on my forehead. It was completely a shocking xp. Please ask the mathangs what does the sleeping hanuman mean.

Thank you for the post.

610. I saw Lord Shiva

Dear Mataang friends
One day I was sleeping , what happened I don't know , I became awake and in kind of trans I saw Lord Shiva and then went back to sleep automatically. Please let me understand what happened since it was neither day dream nor night dream...nor I was praying to Lord Shiva. Yes I do pray to Lord Hanuman everyday.
Also convey my prayers to Lord Hanuman in Shakshat Hanuman Puja and please inform him that I am not well after I lost my mother. Even my father is also not well.
Please pray for the wellbeing of my son, my father and my wife. Also I want to get my mother back...may her passing away be like a bad illusion like chapter 1.
Pranam.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

When your soul connects with Lord Hanuman, it automatically connects with Lord Shiva because Lord Hanuman and Lord Shiva are close to each other. Lord Shiva was trying to destruct sharpness of your memories which you are holding onto. Those sharp memories are creating obstruction in next birth of your mother's souls. Do not think further about your dreams. Let the divine powers do their work.

Blessings

611. i think he was here

I don't know whether it is coincidence or imagination or whether it is real. This happened earlier too. Today morning when i did my pooja, i thought of hanuman as usual, but a little differently and offered flowers. I wondered why there was no mails from setu. When I checked the mail, there was nothing again. I wondered why. In the afternoon I read the ramayan which was stopped for a few days due to a death in the family, followed by the story of hanuman's quest for sita in Lanka. In the evening, something made me go to the pooja room again. I sat there and repeated hanuman chalisa. I felt like meditating for a while. I chanted the manthra ( which got corrected today) and remained there for a short while.I felt a gentle presence. I wondered if hanuman was there then. I couldn't see him for obvious reasons, I understand. Then I thought may be I was imagining. I did not feel like leaving the place but had to for the duties at home. The thought of your mail kept coming. And just now I got it. Are you here? As you are there everywhere, you are. But I want to know ,did you come to me? Am I sensing right? I started my pooja and reading of the ramayan along with devi pooja etc from the new moon day onwards. I was feeling very heavy for the past two days. Now, after reading the fifth chapter, I am feeling a bit relieved. If I have sensed you, anjaneya, I am blessed. Do tell me and make me ready to really see you. Jai hanuman. jai sriram. prostrations and pranams! Pranams to setu masters and sarangs. Hope I am able to see your leela on the 4th. Hope my arpanam reaches you.Sri gurubhyo namah.My pooja continues till the 4th and want to visit a temple. Raam Raam Raam. jai sri Anjaneya.

612. I want to do Sadhna; How should I convince my parents

Pranam Mathangs & Setuu masters

I'm 20 year old kid and I have failed in b.tech &messed up with my life
iam free for one year and recently on Feb 2016 I came to know about Setuu Hanuman website and its stories
When iam reading the stories I just want to run away and come to srilanka near you and have penance in Setuu Hanuman bodhi

But I have parents brothers and relations
Whenever I want to come near you these relations stop me and and when I read Setuu Hanuman stories I just want to run away to setuu Hanuman bodhi

But when I mingle with my routein activities in my daily life Maya catches me
I know that iam in a illusion

Some force pulls me back and says this is real for example a movie or a relative or a neighbour kid or something else deviates me from spiritual path

How many time I say to me that this world is not real and illusion also
This is just a dream not real also
I get anger and iam attached to sense pleasures
I get addicted to tv, movies, and some nonsense
Maya catches me and I can't come out of this illusion

Just I want to come to srilanka and be in Setuu Hanuman bodhi to get this illusion

But I do not know how to convince my parents and my grand mother (she is next mother to me)

They will always why are you always talking like a monk?
You have failed in b.tech now do a degree
And get some job enjoy your life

if I run away to setuu Hanuman bodhi without informing they will be in grief and search for me

I want to leave all attachments

I don't how to convince them

Please tell me how to convince them and come to you

Please waiting for your answer

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Illusion or Maya works in very sophisticated ways.

To engage a monkey into illusion, Maya has to conjure up just a banana.

To engage an ordinary human being into illusion, Maya just has to conjure gold. An ordinary human being would run after gold much to the delight of Maya.

If a person is already rich, Maya just have to create some trouble or worry in their life to keep them engaged.

Suppose a person is broke to the extent that he has given up on everything. Maya fails to engage him in illusion because he is done with everything. Then what will Maya do? It will acquire most stealth approach. It will conjure up an idea of 'spirituality' inside the mind of its target. The target will get attached to an illusion called 'spirituality'. He would think that he is into spirituality, but actually he would be into an illusion of spirituality created by Maya.

You are at this stage. Don't play into the hands of Maya. You cannot get supreme knowledge by running away from your current circumstances. There is a huge difference between 'running away' and 'detaching away'. When you run away from something, you get even more attached to it. You are not eligible for Sadhana until you are at peace with your present. And peace doesn't lie in running away from noise. It lies amidst noise. Running away from noise is called 'holiday' or 'a break'. Setuu Hanuman Bodhi is not a destination to take a break. For that you can choose any resort at any hill station.

613. I want to know the purpose of my life...this is a query

Jai Sri Ram,

From the time I got to know about Setuu site and offering puja online,it gives me immense peace of mind.From childhood I have been away from my parents for education and job purpose till date.In the course of time,I met many people,I would only notice one thing that I have been a solace to many people from childhood from my parents to all people I met and all I meet.I dont have so called friends but I am always there with people in their bad times when they have pain of a broken heart.I pray for their happiness ,they get the happiness and move on.I dont know whether they remember me and I never expect anything in return.Once they get their desired thing I am aloof on the same journey being myself.Each day I am thankful and grateful for my wonderful life my Lord has given me and the best parents ever.

I am always praying for their well being,good health and longevity.The mystery is I dont have a stable job.If I work somewhere I can just work for maximum 8 or 9 months.I am concerned about my spiritual life.I just love to be in peace.I have no high expectations to be famous,rule others and am not ambitious.I just wish whenever someone is in presence of me or speaks to me should be happy and find peace.

I consulted good astrologers regarding my marriage,but all their predictions failed.Everyone in my family among my well wishers are just waiting for it,but my heart has lost all hope,my father gave me some spiritual things so that soon marriage would take place but even they got lost.

Anything related to my marriage if someone is trying to do they are facing some major problems even one of my astrologer uncle,whose all predictions came true,died the next day after he predicted my marriage.I dont know what is the matter.

I just want to know the purpose of my life from Lord Hanuman if granted by my Lord Sri Hari Vishnu.Everyone tells me my Lord loves me very much,but I want that the purpose of my life be revealed to me.

My wish is to love and serve my parents with all my heart mind and soul.I request you ask those Mathang rishis to put forward my query for the sake of my parents will my marriage take place?when ? what is the purpose of my life?

Thank you

Jai Sri Ram

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

It is true that you are close to God. That is precisely the reason why God is taking your soul on the path of Moksha. Basically there are two conflicting desires exhibited by your soul,

(1) "I want stable materialistic life." This desire is exhibited by your conscious mind. When you observe people around you (including your parents), this desire gets enforced.

(2) "I want Moksha". This desire is exhibited by your subconscious mind.

Because of conflict of these two desires, you are virtually stuck at one place. You must take a decision. If you want a stable materialistic life, reduce your attention towards "supreme truth". Then God will understand that you want desire number 1 to be fulfilled. Once your desire 1 is fulfilled in a couple of years, you can resume desire 2.

Blessings

I just want his hug.And i know,he must be smiling know while I'm writing this...Cause he is Almighty.My Shiv!

618. i was feeling that my soul was like coming out from my physical body

when i read chapter 5 after finishing it reading i felt that my soul is feeling light when i gone to sleep when i fell asleep in my bed at night i felt like my soul is coming out from my physical body and want to leave my body and go somewhere but it did not happen just i was feeling like that my soul means that i am coming out of this body which god has granted me .

619. Identity, Who I am or Who we Are.?

This confusion came to my mind while reading one of the chapters here and also that time campaign for donating body parts came in newspapers
Like a machine or car which is made of hundreds of parts.. every part is replacable., and yet the car remains the same, or the registration number remains the same.., for example.. A car registered with number 7652 has 100 parts , let it be named from 1 to 100.., and now in next 100 days due to any reasons we replace every part with a new part.. and now on 101 day we have a car with all different parts from the car we had on day 1, but yet we call it the same car with registratin number 7652. may it be because.. we had a registration card orit happens in daily human life.. watever.. but what about the we..,
our body is made up of different parts., hairs, skin , blodd, bones, eyes, kidney, liver lungs etc..
and in those newspapers i found almost all the body parts can be donated.. some parts can be donated during a healthy life., some can be in coma stage or brain dead stage..or some can be after death.., so, every part is donatable.., this means all those parts can be acceptable also to someone., let's suppose all those parts are transplanted in a body named someone in a timespan of 5 years.., after 5 years he/she has all parts of others.. like.. blood bones eyes skin heart lungs liver etc etc.. then why he/she still be called someone... WHY...
i questioned this to myself and some of my frnds and some knowledgable persons.. there were only 2 answers... one is because of soul and second is brain.. some claims brain is still not donatable.. or still can't be transplanted.. and all persons including me satisfied with the answer that our soul lies in our brain.. but somewhere in my mind i thinks.. mind is only for memories.. (urmi story, where lord hanuman told her to fly out of body).
then after few days i read a article in newspaper that scientist in china are going to transplant a brain in humans for the very first time.., they also claims that they have done thausands of succesfull brain transpanted surgery on rats.... now if dis happens in humans.. if a person with identity or name X got all transplants possible inclusing brain.. whether he should be still called X.. obviously yes.. because X got the transplants.. now my question is.. all parts in X before transplants are now missing and in place of those parts all new parts belonging to M N o P. etc etc are present now.., so why he should be called X nor a combination of MNOP, again answer is obviously the soul... i guess it .. i may be wrong.., but actually the simplyfied question is
" IN which part of our body soul lives or rests.. " as.., why X remains X after all transplants...
dis is like Identity crisis for me..,

hey lord hanuman pls guide me.. or give me power to understand this.. i m highly obliged to you.. thanks.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

This sense of "I" is not because of soul. Suppose we show you video of your soul's previous life, will your soul recognize that person and feel a sense of "I" with that person? NO.

It is not because of memory either. Memory relates to your past, what about the imaginations you have about future? Those imaginations also contribute to sense of "I".

You have a three dimensional existence- Past, Present and Future. This three dimensional existence creates illusion of "I".

And you are changing every moment. You don't have to change all the parts. You are changing every moment. Your cells are dying, new cells are taking birth and so on. You at 7:02:01 PM is completely different from you at 7:02:02PM

The answer to your question is existence which is three dimensional. At any point of time, you have a present, a future and a past. This 3 dimensional existence makes you feel who you are. Existence is a complex topic. Lord Hanuman has started elaborating it from chapter 10. You will read more of it in upcoming chapters.

Yes, your head and your memories can be completely replaced. Still you will feel the sense of "I". You are pursuing an excellent question. Do not let this question die. This question can lead you to realization. You will realize that Past is just an illusion. You think that you have "lived" your past, but that is not so. It is just an illusion. If a sage or God replaces your past, you will still feel that you have lived that past. Read 10th chapter and ponder upon it deeply.

P.S. : The soul doesn't live in the body. It rides the body just like we ride a car. It is driving our body.

620. Idol Worship

Could you please make things clear about idol worship. When did it start and who started it and for what purpose? How is Idol worship supposed to be done correctly. Any correct way to do PranaPratishtha?

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Swayambhu idols have souls in them. You will learn a bit about them in chapter 13 which has been released today. The idols which are not Swayambhu probably have something to do with symbolism. It is better not to speculate until we decipher all the chapters of Lord Hanuman's Leelas.

Blessings

621. idols appeared in dreams are true

Babaji..

whenever i chant hanuman with great devotion i will dreamt of god Hanuman and i will get darshan of hanuman in different idols that i never see anywhere before.. are they really exist in real? once i dreamed as…. i requested before hanuman statue to talk with me and then statue said “tell me.. and when i started saying something god read some verses and he disappeared”.. i usually have this types experiences in my dreams… are these because of my psychological condition?? or god’s delusion..?

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Those are desires which cannot be fulfilled in MaanavLoka at a particular time and space. They get fulfilled in SwapanLoka.

622. IIlusion?

I was happy to read about Lord Hanuman's visit, but was shocked to see that He preached the illusionary nature of the world? Shastras dont support that at all.

The first shloka of the Bhagavatha says that the world is real. We experience it as real. Veda says "Satyam Vishwam maghavAna".

Lord Hanuman born as Shri Madvacharya ( as per veda and as per Vayu purana? says the world is real, then how can Lord Hanuman say that the world, created by His only favourite Lord Rama or Narayana, is illusionary?

That set my mind ringing that this story might not be real, am sorry to say.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Lord Hanuman is not making any declarations here. He is Guru of Mathangs and He has come to give them the Brahmagyan. He knows what He has to speak to them to unsettle their structured beliefs and to make space for the Brahmagyan. We are not the right authority to comment on His words.

623. ill thoughts

Iam unable to perform pooja with peace of mind. Iam getting all bad thoughts and making me get out of meditation

Setu Speaks: 
Do not close your eyes when you pray or meditate. Just observe the sounds and scenes around you. Keep your body still. Feel your presence and presence of everything around you. Just observe everything. Do not try to control your thoughts. If thoughts are coming, just observe the thoughts coming. Do not try to stop them.

624. illusion

illusion is the word created by the divine soul just to test how much we are able to think, we never can overcome from all the illusion without help of hanuman ji

625. illusion

Is the whole universe an illusion?
Is yoga a way to reach God?

Setu Speaks: 
Yes, the illusion of space-time.

Yoga means defying destiny and making Indra Deva and Kaaldeva obey you. Indra Deva can help you get rid of desires and Kaal deva can settle your Karma accounts. When both Karma and Desires are settled, you are free. You get Moksha,

626. illusion of time

As i read the ram setu secret chapter.what i understand about time illusion as follows. suppose sun is centre from where kaal accounibility starts first come bhulok and then pataal so the bhulokis can see future of the pataallokis and pataallokis when they see towards bhulok they see the past time of bhulok.
Now i assume the earth as a tape roll as if like an audio cassette.. now i imagine a mark or time spot on topmost circle.if we see the immediate below layer of tape that will be at a forward position as in a straight line so that is why upperlayer person(bhuloki) can see future of below layered(pataalloki).and if we go to below layer (pataal)n mark a point at that point we can see past of upperlayer(bhulok).

आपके आस पास जो भी आपसे जुड़े हुए हैं , वे चाहे आपके माता पिता हों अथवा वे अजनबी जिनकी आप सहायता करना चाहते हैं , उनकी सहायता अपने आप हो जायेगी अगर आप अपनी स्वयं की सहायता करें | अपनी आत्मा और उसकी शक्ति को पहचानिए | आपके आस पास भ्रम की चादर है , आपके माता पिता व अन्य लोग वास्तव में आपके अन्दर ही हैं | जब आपकी आत्मा खुश होगी तो आप देखेंगे कि कैसे आपके आस पास के लोग भी खुश होते हैं | आपकी आत्मा तब खुश होगी जब आप ऐसा कार्य करेंगे जिससे आपकी आत्मा को संतुष्टि मिले | आपका जन्म यहाँ किस लिए हुआ है , यह जानिये | जीवन का ध्येय पहचानिए | हर आत्मा का ध्येय मोक्ष होना चाहिए , उसी में आत्मा का कल्याण है |

628. An Important Question

Jai Shree Ram
Jai Sita Mata
Jai Bajrangbali

I read everything posted on this website sincerely and try to implement as much as I can. I always wait for the next chapter anxiously. I was just thinking that chapter - 24 is taking a bit longer time, in the meanwhile, yesterday I saw your message that it's because of Assurahs.

Assurahs are everywhere. They influence our life too. We should try that our life shouldn't be influenced by Assurahs. For this, we need to connect to Lord Hanuman and purify our soul which we are doing or trying to do with the help of Setuu. Let's consider my case. I don't know how much I am successful or how much I implement in my life what I read on your website. But I am trying.

Only yesterday, I got to know that the delay in publishing chapter - 24 is due to Assurahs. Assurahs are creating problems to Mathangs and Setuu masters in publishing the chapter. Please correct me if I am wrong. And if I am right, then, my question is if Mathangs and Setuu masters, who are in direct service to Lord Hanuman and Mathangs who have got Brahm Gyaan directly from Lord Hanuman and Setuu Masters who take part in Sakshat Hanuman Puja, are not fully able to get over Assurahs, then, how can a normal person from mainstream society like me be able to get full control over Assurahs? I am just asking. Please forgive me if I ask anything wrong. Waiting for a reply.

Pranam to Mathangs and Setuu Masters.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

At the end, the good side won and chapter was published. Asurrahs are right here. They always put obstacles in the good work. It may take time but the good side always wins. This creation itself is a constant war between good and the evil. If evil is not there, there would be no creation as you know.

Only the enlightened ones realize how important chapter 24 is. After one point, the realized masters face the situation where they lack words to describe the supreme truth. Even great sages couldn't do it. Their words would become incomprehensible and generic after a certain point: like 'truth can not be described in words', 'we can only hint' and so on. Lord Hanuman has done what greatest Rishis in the past couldn't do. Chapter 24 describes what cannot be described. It describes the internal world which can be experienced/realized but almost impossible to describe. The attack of Asurrahs in publication of such words of importance is understandable.

main ek atma jo ki manish naam ke deh main esthir hun main bhagwan hanuman ki 5 adhayay padhne ke bad thoda santi mahsush kiya lekin main apni endriyo ko vash main nahi kar pa raha hu mujhe ye nahi malum hai ki endriyon ko vas main kaise karte hai jiski vajah se main apni lakshya par nahi pahuch paa raha hun kripya kar marg darshan kare....

Setu Speaks: 
मान लीजिये कोई नटखट बच्चा है जो मौका पाते ही शरारत करता है | क्या उसके माता पिता उसे रस्सी से बांधकर रखेंगे ताकि वो शरारत ना करे ? नहीं | माता पिता का घर में होना ही पर्याप्त है | अगर बच्चे को लगेगा कि उसके माता पिता घर में ही हैं और वह शरारत करते पकड़ा जा सकता है तो वह अपने आप ही शरारत नहीं करेगा | कुछ ऐसा ही इन्द्रियों के साथ है | उन्हें बांधकर रखने की आवश्यकता नहीं है | अगर बाँधने की कोशिश करेंगे तो वे ज्यादा बिगड़ सकती हैं | बस उन्हें देखिए | अगर इन्द्रियों से कोई गलती हो जाती है तो इन्द्रियों की गलती का बोझ अपने सिर मत लीजिये | आप एक आत्मा हैं , शरीर हैं | शरीर जो करता है करने दीजिये | कुछ दिन में आप देखेंगे कि शरीर भी खुद ब खुद सुधर जाएगा |

हाँ छटा अध्याय पढने के बाद आपको एक बात और पता चली होगी --- कि आपका शरीर सुर तथा असुर भी प्रयोग करते है | अगर एक बार किसी असुर को आपके शरीर की आदत लग जाए तो वह बार बार शरीर में आने की कोशिश करेगा | अगर असुर को एक बार फटकार लग जाए कि उसके बुरे कर्म इस शरीर के माध्यम से संभव नहीं हैं तो वह नहीं आएगा| इसलिए इन्द्रिय परिग्रह भी आवश्यक है | अगर कोई बुरा कार्य करते समय आपका शरीर आपके वस में नहीं रहता तो यह अवश्य असुर के नियंत्रण में है | जब भी कोई बुरा कार्य करने की मन में आये तो समझ लीजिये कि कोई असुर आपको बहला फुसलाकर आपके शरीर का उपयोग करना चाह रहा है | उसे वही पर फटकार लगा दीजिये तो वह फिर से नहीं आएगा |


630. INFINITE HONOUR

I have too much honour for lord HANUMAN. Recently I got sudden financial loss. I think I will get back this soon with interest.

631. Infinite number of Worlds

Jai Siya Ram
Jai Hanuman

The world in which we are living is just one world out of infinite number of parallel worlds. I want to know more about this infinite number of worlds.

In chapter-1, the lady was on deathbed in one world which is termed as bad illusion and the same lady was alright in another world and this is termed as good illusion. Lord Hanuman helped the monk in jumping from one illusion to another. An ordinary human being cannot jump from one illusion to another. An ordinary human being would live a complete life in one world i.e. under a single illusion. But the monk had performed austerities in life. That is why Lord Hanuman could jump him fom bad illusion to good illusion.

I have read more about infinite number of worlds on your website. For example, a person is a beggar in one world while in another world the same person is very rich. Now, my question is Are the souls of both the persons in two different worlds same or different? Both the persons are same but they are in living different worlds and they cannot interact. So, are both the souls same or different? Also, why can't they interact?

This is about two different worlds. But you say that there are infinite number of parallel worlds. Can't the people from these infinite parallel worlds interact? Are the people same in all these infinite parallel worlds? Are there the same souls in these infinite parallel worlds?

Please answer my questions and tell me more about infinite number of parallel worlds. It's quite interesting to know that a person just like me is also living in some different world. But I don't know him. I wish I could interact with him. Please tell me if there is any way I can interact with him? If not, then, why?

Thank you Setuu
Thank you Mathangs
Regards

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Ponder yourself. Think deeply. Shooting questions from outer mind will not help. Think and try to find answers yourself. Even if you don't find an answer by thinking, you will progress on the path of supreme truth. But by shooting questions from outer mind and seeking ready made answers, you will only go backward or remain stuck at the same place.

633. Isse kalp ke baar HANUMAAN JI kaha chale jayenge ?

Continued from #508063
Iss kalp ke baad Hanuman ji kaha chale jayenge... kya ve moksh chale jayenge ?

Setu Speaks: 
विष्णु लोक में |


634. It is a query-

Rama Ram Ram

I submit this query after a lot of contemplation whether to ask and how to post this query etc.

My question is even if I chant Ram Nam regularly, why dont i get any sort of guidance from within or from some other super natural sources.

What ever i do or think or decide to do, everything goes waste or in other words, my actions and efforts give the opposite reactions and results. Why????? I start with lots of confidence and positive thoughts and with good energy levels and what ever is needed for the particular actions - Then too they go in vain.

WHY?????

I need some guidance - for what to do - when to do - or how to !!!!

How will i get the proper guidance??????

When will I get success in my life??????

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

You are not getting success because you are desperate for it. You are not at peace with your present, how can your future be peaceful and better. For instance, you haven't read even all the chapters of Lord Hanuman's Leelas published here. You don't do anything with patience because you are not comfortable with the way you are right now. You want to run away from your present. See, what you currently are right now is a sum total of your Karmas and Desires of past. You have to accept your past and present, then only future can be better.

Don't chant Ram Nam just for motive of fulfilling desires. Chant it with your heart. First realize who you are? Are you a piece of blood and flesh which has some desires. Or are you something higher than that? Contemplate.

Blessings

635. It seems I become eligible

Jai Shree Ram ! Jai Jai Hanuman !!

In chapter 18, it was mentioned that this truth cannot be explained to all. So if we came to know about this truth, does it means that we became eligible for this truth.

As you said (in answer of other devotees), that this chapter seeds questions in one's mind so that he\she can promote their selves. There is number of questions in my mind also and one of them is -

What is Kamdhenu ? I am still thinking about this only thing.

My Thoughts : in this question, sage said that don't limit to your mind and go beyond it to solve this puzzle. I think that to go beyond this mind we have to take help of this mind to awaken our "Chetana" because I think this is only thing which can help us to go beyond the mind. But to awaken "Chetna" we still need our mind which has all the Gyan in it.

All the knowledge I have, I came to the conclusion that Kamdhenu is the Guru | Milk is that knowledge given by Guru | That Gyan is the Base of "Astitava" and if we have that Gyan then we can fulfill our wish without efforts.

I also think that I know that how to fulfill wishes without efforts. In previous chapters you explained that if we give up our "Bhagye" the Lord Indra offer us some choice that we can select or demand. So we give up our "Bhagye" then we can fulfill our wishes from him. Right ? Is it that Gyan but this cannot be the base of Astitava.

But somewhere I am feeling that I am lacking somewhere it could be or couldn't be the correct answer.

I am confuse. please help me

Please correct me If I am wrong and help me to walk ahead.

Jai Shree Ram ! Jai Jai Hanuman !!

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Kaamdhenu is not Guru. You are doing the same mistake which was done by king Arjuna. Human mind wants to categorize everything and put a label on it. Your mind wants to put the label of 'Kaamdhenu' on Guru. Mind wants comfort and questions give discomfort to mind. Specially the questions which have potential to take you beyond mind. Don't yield to tendencies of mind. If we tell the answer, you will lack the knowledge which you would have got in the process of getting the answer. Keep the question in mind. The answer will strike you all of a sudden.

636. is it true..

kya yeh stye h ki bhuke rhne se hanuman ji jaldi sunte h?

Setu Speaks: 
नहीं , यह सत्य नहीं है |

हाँ , व्रत करने से आपको अपने तन मन से उपर आत्मा के स्तर पर पहुँचने में मदद अवश्य मिल सकती है | जब आप आत्मा के स्तर पर होते हैं तभी आप हनुमान जी के साथ संपर्क करने योग्य होते हैं |

637. Jai Anjeneyar

I have just completed my fast for Anjeneyar this and last year. I started the fast last year and he helped me to carry on by giving me the strength and courage to move forward when i was in my lowest point. We are not out of it yet as I pray to him everyday. I cannot afford to provide him anything but a simple glass of water and sometimes raisins or fruit. I have felt his energy and I cant describe what it was but it felt so calm and peaceful expecialy when chanting Hanuman chalisa.
Oh Lord, I know you have heard my plea and cries and I am still pleading with you for help. Om Sri Rama Jayam.

Ever since childhood I have been a devotee of Hanumanji. I have immense faith in lord Hanuman. Hanumanji has always been protecting me from all kinds of evils and troubles. I have grown up worshipping lord Hanuman and all these years my faith in lord Hanuman has grown manifold times. Before starting any work I rarely forget to remember Hanumanji. He makes my work successful most of the times. Hanumanji, everything is visible to you. You know everything. Please forgive me and my parents if knowingly or unknowingly we have made any mistakes either in this birth or in previous births. I have also got my Charan Pooja done by the Mathangs. Also, I have offered some fruits to lord Hanuman after reading Chapter-1 of Setuu. Hanumanji, please accept my prayers and offerings and bless me and my parents. Hanumanji, please bless me with a good job. Also, help us become good souls. Hanumanji, keep your blessings on me and my parents and guide us to follow in the right direction of life which leads to you and make our souls so pure that we can get your glimpse. Hanumanji, I really want to have your glimpse in this life of mine. So, Hanumanji, please help in making my soul so pure that I can have your glimpse in this life with my naked eyes. I really want to thank Setuu and the Mathangs from the core of my heart for helping people connect with almighty Hanuman. They are really doing a great job and that must be appreciated. Jai Bajrangbali. Jai Shree Ram.

Hai hanuman ji madat karo app sab jante ho ki kiya ho RHA hai meri jindgi mein madat karo bajrangbali

648. Jai Bajrangbali-2

Ever since childhood I have been a devotee of Lord Hanuman. I have full faith in Lord Hanuman. I know I have his blessings. Whatever I am today and whatever I have achieved in my life till today, that's all because of his blessings. I rarely forget to take his name before I start any work. Most of the times my prayers have been accepted except for some. In all these days my devotion towards Lord Hanuman has increased only. The unanswered prayers have not lessened my faith and devotion in Lord Hanuman even a bit.

Last year while surfing on internet, I got to know about your website Setuu. I went through it. At first, I thought it's also like other websites which cheat people in the name of God. But later I couldn't stop myself and booked Charan Pooja for myself. I got the date of Charan Pooja on 13/05/14. I felt very relieved the moment I booked Charan Pooja. I thought now I will get the blessings of Lord Hanuman and everything good will happen to me. I was excited too. I got the mail that Charan Pooja of Shri Hanumanji was performed for me on 13/05/14 and it was completed without any Vighnam. I didn't get any rare message from Hanumanji or the Mathangs or Setuu.

I was happy that Charan Pooja was completed without any Vighnam. At that time, I was in the final year of my Post Graduation. Days passed and nothing miraculously happened. Neither I had expected. But somewhere in my heart I had a feeling that now everything good would happen with me. I was feeling relieved and confident. I successfully completed my PG with Lord Hanuman's grace.

But I was not able to get a job or admission to Phd. I was very much disturbed and many a times got frustrated too. Days passed like this only. Everytime I prayed to Lord Hanuman for my job and Phd. Finally, that day came when my prayer was accepted and I got a job in a software company. I was happy that Lord Hanuman accepted my prayer and I thanked him from the core of my heart.

But soon after joining the job, I started facing problem in my training. I prayed to Lord Hanuman that anyhow I just complete my training. But I couldn't complete my training and I lost my job.

I never get anything easily. I don't have peace in my life. After completing my schooling, I have to wait for a year to get admission in engineering and that too somehow. After completing my engineering with God's grace, I couldn't get any job. Even after trying hard, I didn't get any job. Then I joined a coaching institute and started preparing for government jobs. Even there I failed. I couldn't get any government job. But with God's grace I cracked gate(a competitive exam) and got admission in PG. Again aftet PG, I had to wait for around six months to get my first job. But that too didn't last long. I had my job only for three months.

I don't know why all this is happening to me. Many people(astrologers) say that it's because of some dosh in my horoscope(kundali) while others say that it's because of our house problem or vaastu problem. I don't know what is the real reason which is stopping me from getting success and peace.

Right now I am very disturbed and not able to concentrate on one thing. So many thoughts come to mind. Sometimes I think to go for Phd while sometimes for IT jobs while sometimes for government jobs. I am getting confused. I don't know which way I should go. I often get frustrated and sometimes depressed too.

Also, I have some health issues.

Will I ever be able to get peace? When will I get another job rather permanent job? Will I ever be fully fit without any health issues? When will I settle in life? I need to get answer of these questions.

Regarding the job that I lost, I got to know later through Setuu that it was my fault. I complicated my prayers to get fast result. I involved my parents and society in my prayer. That was my fault. But now it's only you and me Hanumanji. Please accept my prayer now again Hanumanji.

I request the Mathangs to pray to Lord Hanuman in Sakshat Hanuman Pooja for my peace, good permanent job and health on my behalf.

I have full faith in Lord Hanuman. I strongly believe that Lord Hanuman will give me a very good and permanent job very soon. Also, all my health problems will vanish and I will get peace of mind. Soon I will settle in life. Hanumanji, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly either in this birth or previous births. Please purify my soul and mind and give me positive energy so that there is no place for negativity in my soul and mind. Please keep your blessings on me forever.

Jai Bajrangbali
Jai Shree Ram

May God bless everyone.

Thank you Mathangs
Thank you Setuu

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,
Take care of these 4 things-
(1) Make sure you have a deep desire to reach goals.
(2) Make sufficient efforts required to fulfill that desire otherwise your soul will just go to Swapan Lok and fulfill those deep desires. It will never become reality here in this world.
(3) In order to get help of Lord Hanuman in removing obstacles, never allow demons of "fear" and "worry" etc make room in your heart and mind. If these demons remain there, you will not get help of Lord Hanuman. Because that would indicate that you prefer demons over Lord Hanuman.
(4) Keep your prayer simple. Just ask, "O Lord, fulfill my wishes." Do not bring your family, society and world into your wish. Otherwise their Karma will also affect you. Just keep it between you and Lord. Nobody else. Everyone related to you will automatically get fruits when your wish gets fulfilled.

(2) उन इच्छाओं को पूरा करने के लिए आवश्यक प्रयास करें अन्यथा आपकी आत्मा उन लक्ष्यों को इस संसार में पूरा करने की बजाय स्वपन लोक में पूरे कर लेगी |
(3) अपने दिल दिमाग में “भय” “चिंता” आदि नाम के दानवों को जगह न बनाने दे अन्यथा हनुमान जी को लगेगा कि आप उनकी बजाय दानवों को अपने दिल दिमाग में रखना पसंद करते हैं | बाधाएं दूर करने के लिए हनुमान जी की सहायता प्राप्त करने के लिय यह अति आवश्यक है |
(4) अगर आपका मन अपने कार्य की बजाय अन्य गतिविधियों में लगता है तो समझ लीजिये कि असुर आपके आस पास मंडराते हैं | असुर आपकी देह और मन का प्रयोग कर रहे हैं | असुरों का स्वभाव है कि उन्हें एक बार असफलता मिल जाए (देह - मन का प्रयोग करने में ) तो वे दूर चले जाते हैं | जब आपको लगे कि आप कुछ गलत कर रहे हैं तो तुरंत विरोध करें , असुर आपसे दूर चले जायेंगे |
(5) अपनी प्रार्थना को सरल रखें | अपनी प्रार्थना अपने और प्रभु के बीच रहने दें उसमे आप परिवार , समाज तथा अन्य लोगो को शामिल न करें | सही प्रार्थना - “हे प्रभु मेरी आवश्यकताए पूरी करें ताकि मै मोक्ष के मार्ग पर चल सकूँ |” गलत प्रार्थना - “मेरे जीवन में फलां व्यक्ति को ले आयें , मेरे परिवार को ऐसा करें , मेरे समाज को ऐसा करें|” आप जितने लोगो को अपनी प्रार्थना में शामिल करेंगे उतने लोगो के कर्म रोड़ा बनते जायेंगे |

651. Jai Bhajarangabali!!!

I firstly want to express my heartfelt gratitude for all the blessings I have received in my life so far and for all the blessing I would receive in the future!!! I'm very grateful for Setuu Masters for connecting many souls to Shri Anjaneya through the divine Mathangs!!

I can feel Shri Hanuman in my every breath, every step and every heartbeat.. I know that HE is guiding me through my intuitions..

Hanuma deva, you know my past and my present and my future.. You know I have suffered since my marriage, I've tried my best to do good deeds, be calm, forgiving and loving all the time.. I strongly feel the influence of Assurahs in my marital life, I know my husband has a good soul but he's unable to control the bad influence of assurahs because of which both our families are in great turmoil..
could you please give me and my loved ones harmony by removing obstacles from my married life?

Are assurahs affecting all of us or it's our bad karma collectively manifesting simultaneously?

Anjaneya I humbly pray to you to keep assurahs away from me and my loved ones.. I want my baby to be with his father and also my parents without difficulties..

Deva kindly remove my karmas from my past lives and bless me with knowledge..
May I chant mrityunjaya mantra to attain moksha and break the cycle of life and death?

Tvamasmin karya niryoge pramanam
Harisattama
Hanuman yatna maastaya dukha kshaya karo Bhava

My humble pranams to you deva

Thank you Setuu and Mathangs

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Everything around is you is a manifestation of your inner being. If you shift your point of existence, everything around you shall change. If you instead try to change things around you, you will get trapped more and more into this quicksand. Love your inner being and everyone around you will love you. Search your inner being and everyone you want in your life will automatically get attracted towards you.

Another advice for you is this : Oftentimes we figure out that a particular person is causing us troubles and we start hating that person. Hate is a form of attachment. More you hate that person, more troubles you will get. If a person seems to be cause of your troubles, immediately cut connections with that person. Neither hate nor love that person. That person can be an imaginary person who you think may be influencing decisions of your loved ones. Do not hate/love that imaginary person also. That is the only way to save ourselves from the Asurrahs who are mounted on other people's beings.

If an Asurrah is mounting on you, for example you get angry or exhibit negativity, then there is another way to get rid of that Asurrah. You must be able to differentiate between yourself and the Asurrah. When you do something negative, you should immediately realize that this is not you, this must be an Asurrah who got hold of your mind. If you start recognizing the Asurrah's actions done through you, the Asurrah will go away. Never own up the actions done by Asurrah through your body-mind, otherwise you will have to face the consequences of their actions.

Mantra alone won't help for Moksha. First of all you seek to know who you are. Seek and then you will meet a Guru - visible or invisible. Then you will proceed on path of Moksha.

Blessings

Jai Sri Ram Jai Hanuman !!!

Respected higher souls,

Lord Vishnu is my friend, guide His leelas attract me like no other, though I still have high respect towards Lord Ganesh, LordShiva&Lalitambika, Lord Hanuman, Lord Murugan..

1. I wish my husband gets good longterm job, So we can spend our energy on devotional activites and provide better future for our son.
2. I have stopped traditional puja like litting diya, arpanam(prasadam) at home, waiting to get better place so I can sit and do puja whole heartedly. but im feeling guilty for not making more efforts. I still pray in my heart though ask for blessing of Lord Vishnu and Lord Hanuman. Am I doing it right?
3.Prayer: O Lord Hanuman, let me be happy and content. Let all my needs be met. Please help me forgive and forget my bad memories.

Please pass my humble queries and prayer to Lord Hanuman.

I'm helpless I keep thinking about people who used to like me I am not sure whether they really like me or not because of them I had problems however when they stop liking me just because they think I'm in happy place is it my fault or there's? I hope Lord Hanuman helps me get over bad memories

Jai SRIRAMARAMARAMA !!!!

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul

(1) You should not feel any need of approval of others on your relationship with your God. If it feels right to your soul, it is right. The traditions set by Rishis in general may be overruled by the traditions of the family set by the family Guru/ancestors. And traditions of family can be overruled by the devotee if their soul is connected with the Lord.

(2) It is nobody's fault. Human relationships of Kaliyuga work this way only. If you are in a bad position, your relatives/friends will desert you out of contempt. If you are in good position, they will desert you out of jealousy/misunderstanding. Focus on the only relationship which is true: Your soul's relationship with the supreme.

Blessings

main yeh janna chahti hu ki kya hanumaan ji ladies ko be darshan dete hai. main tuesday k fast rakhti hu but mujhe sab log yahi kehte hai k hanumaan ji k fast only male rakhte hai not female. bachpan seh he yahi sunna hai k hanumaan ji ki pooja female nhi karti or nah he unko murti ko touch be nhi karti. kya ladies tuesday ka fast rakh sakti hai or kya ladies hanumaan ji ki pooja kar sakti hai? kya hanumaan ji ladies ko darshan dete hai?
family main reh kar hum kaise moh or maya ka tyag kare k hum ko bhagwan k darshan ho sake?

Setu Speaks: 
देखिये हनुमान जी की पूजा शरीर से नहीं होती , मन से होती है | जिस मन में भक्ति हो वह मन भक्त का मन होता है किसी औरत या पुरुष का नहीं | अगर पूजा कक्ष में हम शरीर से ऊपर उठ जाते हैं इसलिए यह केवल भ्रम है कि स्त्रियों को हनुमान जी की पूजा नहीं करनी चाहिए | यह भ्रम फ़ैलाने वाले मुर्ख हैं |

शुरुआत तो यहाँ पर अध्याय पढ़कर कीजिये आपको मोह से दूर होने में सहायता मिलेगी | मोह और प्रेम में अंतर होता है | उस अंतर को समझने में सहायता मिलेगी | पहला अध्याय तो मोह पर ही तो आधारित है | उसे फिर से पढ़िए |

663. Jai Hanuman

Namaste....(Hello)

I thank the Setuu community to make me aware about LORD HANUMAN and other related knowledge.

I have a question, what tasks we have to do to become so pure that I could see LORD HANUMAN with physical eyes as MATHANGS can do.

Have to do some special kinds of Prayers or Yoga or make some particular habits to be pure souls.

kindly Reply.

Jai Shree Ram
Jai Hanuman

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

Just start observing yourself. In a given day, you observe many people and things. Make habit of observing yourself while you are indulged in worldly activities. One simple way to observe is to address yourself as third person.

For example, suppose your name is XYZ. When you are doing something, think in your mind, "XYZ is doing this. XYZ is doing that."

Then think if "XYZ" is doing this thing and I can see "XYZ" doing this thing, then who am I? Am I XYZ or someone who is observing XYZ?

I am fortunate enough to have the opportunity of going through

After reading the Chapters I had divine experiences

and which are clearly told to us.Experiences are refined and more

Positive Energies are Felt. I am reading with Total devotion and surrender

to My God Hanuman Ji. Jai Sri Ram.

670. Jai Hanuman

My dear lord,
I truly believe that you are here around me to take care of us, I am no one to ask anything from you. We have very tiny hands to take but you have very large hands to give.
I only have one request to give me strength, peace please my mind, a feeling of satisfaction,avoid feeling of hatred and revenge and ability to keep my loved once happy. And the devil who has entered in my family who is killing them one by one pl take him away from my family.
Please give me an apportunity to meet you , to see you in this life.

Jai Shree Ram
Jai Hanuman ji
I am 22 years old and i am very lazy. From childhood i am living with my mother's relatives and feels like they have lead my life. I have not take any decisions in my life. From childhood i am living absent minded. My parents(relatives of mother) didn't let me mix up with same age peoples in childhood and by sitting in house most of time i was done day dreaming. I don't have good career, i dont have friends, i dont have harmony and love relatives and dont know much peoples outside relatives. Being in house most of day i started to read religious, spiritual websites and feels influenced by many things like non-attachment, bhakti, and even used to go at sahaj yoga center(with one relative who is sahaj yogi).
I am very confused right now about how should i live life, and what things am able to do. My material condition is very bad( as i am not able to take my decisions, don't have my opinions and do as some peoples tell me to do, don't have good career, and belong to poor family) In spirituality i have some practical knowledge but not able to have full faith or be with certain type of sadhana.
Please guide me.
Jay Hanuman ji

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

That can prove to be a boon if you set your life purpose as Moksha or getting supreme knowledge. It is a blessing that you are different from the crowd. Make use of it and seek the supreme truth.

681. Jai Hanuman...

Dear knowledge giver i want to know how can i figure out on what stage my soul is to be free from any karma or desire as i am also a normal soul and living in this life of illusion. And how much my soul's bad karma is due to at least reach the karma of my soul is required to gain this knowledge directly from great Pra shakti LORD HANUMAN himself. And is there any possibility of knowing my previous birth and the purpose of this life.

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

If it were necessary for a human to know previous birth, we would all take birth with memory of previous births. Story of previous birth is told by sages only if it is required for world welfare. Your purpose is to get Moksha.

Thank you so much Lord Hanuman ...i did not know about this Setu Hanuman ..i should thank my brother in law who told me about this website. I have started reading the chapters just now and i feel i am blessed .. i can share this information with my husband and children.

Jai Shriram ..Jai Hanuman

683. Jai Hanuman

Namaste Sir/Madam,
For a long time now, I have delayed and procrastinated writing this mail. I want to visit your ashram in Pittrubhu hills, meet Lord Hanuman and get set on my journey to attain Moksha. But, I am not yet ready to leave behind my identity and all that I have considered to be mine so far. I am at the cross roads and don't know which way to take. Help me with making my decision.

Regards,

Setu Speaks: 
Divine Soul,

The journey to Moksha can be started from anywhere. All you have to do is start seeking the absolute truth. All the paths will open up by itself.

If you want to do Sadhana at Setuu Hanuman Bodhi, please answer following questions :

(1) Describe your devotion towards Lord Hanuman. How it started and how it evolved over time.

(2) Have you ever met Lord Hanuman in MaanavLoka or SwapanLoka? Describe that experience. What was the conversation between you and Lord Hanuman.

(3) Who are you? If you are a soul, how far is Lord Hanuman from you. How do you think you can cover the distance between you and Lord Hanuman.

(4) What did you learn/unlearn from chapters of Lord Hanuman's Leelas posted so far. Write your views about each chapter.

Blessings

Thank you so much Guru ji..

i got a job after four years.. i request you to be with me.. so that i do my job under your guidance... protect me in this alien place.

698. jai hanuman ji ki

I have read all 14 chapters and waiting for the day when next will be published and I am really thankful to you for sharing...

I have full faith in Hanuman ji and hanuman ji has helped me in various ways..Once long time back. Some one took Rs 20000 from my father and was not returning the money back.... for more than 1 year that person didn't returned the money.. We thought that we will never get the money back.. so we left the hope..
then a time came when we faced big financial crisis and I could see the tension in my fathers face,, As I was only studying in the 2nd year of Engineering ... & could not able to do any help .. I was also not feeling good.... Then one night as usually I do before sleeping ,,, I talk to Hanumanji mentally .... One thought came to my mind if that person returns the money... it will help us a lot.. So while thinking about hanuman ji ... I heard a voice mentally .. It was not actually voice but something like Hanuman Ji asked me .. He gave me 2 options

Do you want that money back from that person or Do you want to win a lottery ?
I said , I just want that the person should return the money to my father please.. and then I slept...

next morning , infact very early , when I was sleeping only, I heard someone ring the door bell, and I heard while sleeping that some one came.. I was feeling sleepy so I kept sleeping late..

But when I wake up and asked who came so early morning ,, I was shocked to know that the same person came and returned full money ..... I can't tell how I felt ,,, i was so happy to know that yesterday night it was hanuman ji who actually asked me and listened my prayer...

Its been 10 years now and I still talk to Hanumanji..... but now I dont know why I am not getting that kind of feeling that I normally had while talking to Hanuman ji..

I think I did something wrong which suddenly took him far away from me ... that makes me very sad from inside..
Please help me

Yes, you can buy fruits anywhere and do arpanam. Prefer a temple where Vaanaras are present and the priest is skilled enough to do the Arpanam rightly. Otherwise do Arpanam at home and feed the fruits to Vaanaras, kids or Daridra Narayanas.

Ye adhyay padhkar dil ko bahut sukun mila , aur ye ahsaas hua ki prabhu hamare aas paas hi hai , aur bahut jaldi mere bhi dukho ka nivaran karenge , aur agar mujhse koi galti hui hai ,ya me kuch galat kar rahi hu to mujhe sahi raasta dikhyenge. bus itni hi prarthna hai ki hey prabhu hum par apna aashirwaad sadev banaye rakhna.

701. Jai Hanumanji

Jai Hamumanji, Jai Bajrangballi,

Apka Ashirdad Hamare Uppar Sadhai Bani Rahe.

Jai Hanumanji

702. Jai Hanumanji

Hari Om,Jai Hanumanji,i have experienced hanumanji throughout my life every moment lord is with me and my family and each and every person in this world,whatever is good for me and my family lord does it very smothly.

whatever happens good or bad we have to face,but lord does it such a way that i have never felt bad days going off so smoothly,my daughter went for picnic and there many monkeys were troubling all her friends and she got so frightened she just closed her eyes and prayed hanumanji u won't believe non of the monkeys came close to her infact all her friends were saying we will stand with u so that they won't come near to them,these r small incidents but i ca only say lord is with us and we wish lord be with us thru out our life.
