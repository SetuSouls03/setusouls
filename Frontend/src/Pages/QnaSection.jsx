      question: "Jai Shree Ram   I have been divorced for almost 2 years now. I had agree for divorce due to certain issues though internally I never wanted to separate from my husband whom I dearly love till this moment. No second in the day passes when I dont think about him or miss him. The memories haunt me badly. Though it has been more than 2 years since everything ended and we have not been in contact but something inside me still says that we are meant to be together and one day we will reunite. What should I perceive from this inner voice? My family is after me to marry again but I can't. My mind and soul dont permit for the same. I can't think of anyone in place of my ex husband. Please help me.",
      answer: "Have you read Chapter 2 of Immortal Talks- Book 1? It tells about the mathematics of Karma.If this attachment to your ex-husband is one-sided, you are doing immense harm to yourself and your family. Every soul has bad Karma and because of one-sided attachment you are taking on your husband's Karma on yourself thereby creating more and more suffering for yourself.So, if it is a one-sided attachment, earlier you let go of him, is better. Marry again only and only when you've let go of this one-sided attachment otherwise the new companion and his family will also suffer due to this one-sided attachment.",

      answer: `At this stage of Kaliyuga when people are deeply fallen into the pit of Maya, they won't take free knowledge seriously. Furthermore, they may raise suspicions over it, Therefore, we are now presenting this knowledge in the form of books. If you actually want them to follow this knowledge, don't give it free.

      question: "Hai hanuman. I might be pregnant. My husband doesnt want to go for abortion but i am not sure about having a baby. I had a few questions running in my head. I understand pregnancy is more a spiritual process than physical. The strings of space and time come together from both the parents for the new life to start. If its being disrupted, then it should be equivalent to a murder. Is it so? I want to understand if there can be any spiritual consequences for abortion. For the souls of the parents as well as the unborn child. What happens spititually? It is said in the lessons, a soul has to decide to come down for new life to happen otherwise asuras take residence in the body of the new child. So, in case of artificial pregnancy what happens? A decade back, i heard from a spiritual practitioner a soul decends down during the 6th month of pregnancy. Is this true?",
      answer: "Human body is like a house of a soul.Murder is like bulldozing an already-built house where somebody is already living. Comparing abortion and murder is sheer ignorance.Here is a simple way to explain pregnancy. You are pregnant. That means you have started building a house (read 'body') for a soul. Where is that soul right now which might become your child? That soul is not body-less right now. Lets say that soul is living in body of a 70 year old woman somewhere. That body is becoming a burden for the soul day by day. That old body is getting more and more insufficient and incompatible for the Karma-Desires that soul has accumulated. That soul is looking for an exit from that body. Lets say that soul finds a possibility of acquiring the body that is developing in your uterus.Right now the body you are developing in your uterus is just a possibility for that soul. If you abort your plans and carry out the abortion, what will happen? That soul will keep living in the 70 year old body while searching for another possibility.So in a way, you will be giving a few months of more life to that 70 years old woman by carrying out abortion.But if you look the other way, if you don't do abortion, you will be giving a new body to that soul. You will be freeing it from the old 70-year old body.So there is nothing good or bad here. If you think you are not yet ready to host the new soul, go ahead with the abortion.But yes, if you abort now and conceive later, another soul will come as your child, not the one we are talking about now. Once you abort, you give a clear signal to this soul to find new possibilities. It may take some time to find new possibilities but eventually it will find one and become someone else's child.",

      question: "Jai sri Ram, Jai sri Hanuman I have many experiences to tell but I don't tell all the incidents as they might not be so important to be posted .... But they are priceless for me.So ,2-3 months ago -I was on Facebook ..... I am also a member of a group (perhaps made by the setuu sadhakas ) named setuu.orgAs usual a member of the group asked a random question and as I was a member so I was also notified. I saw many replies for that question but one of them made me sure that the person who replied it was a setuu's sadhaka.So I sent him friend request and what a coincidence that he also accepted it He accepted the friend request because he thought that I am his one of the friends (Perhaps classmate) in his schooldays . But I had nothing to do with that because I thought that now I can talk to a person who will share his divine knowledge with me and I could also ask him about any queries (if I had ) .I knew it that his answers to my questions will be better than that of mine and he will also answer all my questions (even when it is meaningless ) I assumed that at least he will tell me that the question I asked was meaningless. So now come to our chats on Facebook:First I however confirmed that he was a sadhaka then we had a conversation ..He asked me if I had read all the chapters posted on setuu up to now ...... I answered \"yes\".So he asked me a question :Q. We all know Lord Shiva goes in samadhi - I replied \"yes\" He asked - Do you know when he is in samadhi then he meditates on whom ?(In Hindi - \"Kya tum jante ho ki WO kiska dhyan karte hai jab WO samadhi me hote hai\" ?I had an answer but I was not sure if it was correct so I thought that i should search on Google to ensure that my answer was correct . And yes I got the same answer also on Google (Internet).This time I was not sure that the answer is correct (as I knew that all the vedic literatures were not like as it was written , in the past centuries many changes are made in them) but though I sent the answer . Unfortunately it was wrong according to him and he just told me that I was judging and I should not do it any more as it invites ashuras . I knew about the judgements (according to the chapters posted on setuu website).He told me that i had not gone through the chapters in detail ,, and the answer is in chapter 11th , or perhaps 12th ( I don't exactly remember what he said) . .. So I went through the chapters again but I still don't have an answer for this question. Please answer this question. As soon as possible.Jai sri Sita-Ram Jai Sri Hanuman",
      answer: "None of Setuu Sadhakas are member of any internet group. The group you mentioned may be started by devotees who read chapters on website just like you.Now that so many chapters have been published, we don't think there is any need to add our thoughts on the words of the immortal Guru. We suggest devotees to find answers only in chapters. There are a billion human minds having billions of thoughts. Instead of relying on thoughts generated in minds of mortal human beings, rely on the words of the Immortal Guru.Blessings",

In language of computers 0 and 1 make every complex thing. Similarly in this world Karma and Desire form infinite identities.	For example a unique mixture of Karma and Desire gets identity of a person called Bhavna.	Bhavna can shed its Karma Desires, get back to Shunya, and then accumulate another unique mixture of Karma-Desire to get another identity, say Supriya.	Only this much can be explained.

      answer: "Divine Soul,	Higher purpose is necessary for happiness in life. There are four categories of human endeavors or purposes in life- (1) Artha (2) Kama (3) Dharma (4) Moksha	Artha means earning livelihood. Every human being does that.	Kama means building relationships, friendships etc. Poor people can't afford Kama. They spend their life worrying and earning for food and basic necessities (Artha). Once your basic necessities are taken care of, you start building relationships. It gives you joy inviting someone at home and going at someone's place as guest. It gives you pleasure building relationships of various kinds.	Dharma means social services. Not everyone can afford that. Most people remain busy with Artha and Kama. Those who are lucky enough to be rich in terms of money as well as relationships, they enjoy being part of society and getting fame and recognition.	Moksha is the highest of human endeavors. Those who are satisfied in terms of Artha, fulfilled in terms of Kama, and content with their Dharma go on the path of Moksha. It is another matter that some people never get satisfied with Artha and keep earning money. Some people are so insecure that they remain entangled in relationships and cannot think of life without friends/family etc. Some people remain stuck in Dharma and never go a step beyond on the path of Moksha.

First i realized about him and so my love got deep roots to lord Krishna. Lord Krishna teaches me lot of knowledge that all souls are children of lord vishnu. So, i should take care of them and direct to lord vishnu that's moksha. After realizing more knowledge of soul and purpose of life i was not able to live in this circle of generation. Krishna taught how to tolerate in this circle. I feel krishna speaks to me and guide me. Mostly am imagining enjoying with krishna  as my son brother and supporter and share my love with my cousin ******* (she is also a great devotee of lord Krishna).She is just 16 but she understands and realize the purpose of life and attaining moksha. And i am  22, i wish to do service for all and live a saintly life.But lord Krishna adviced me to get married to sow this seed of knowledge into my family and children. But now-days i am confusion whether krishna speaking with me is illusion. I know his love to me is not illusion. But whether really lord krishna wants me to get married. I want to live as per his wishes. His love enough for me. But wanted to know whether i am in any illusion? . And i am always getting dreams weird and people sleeping around me say  that i am screaming like anything daily night and start walking in sleep. As i go to swapna lokha whether any asura take my body? I prayed to lord hanuman and my mom writes Shree Rama Jayam 108 times for me to sleep well. I am worried about this. And i feel whether lord hanuman is liitle anger with me. I seek hanumanji blessings for my marriage. I always bow to lord hanumanji!!!!",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	That is not illusion. You are a blessed soul as evolved as that of an ascetic. You go to a higher plane and get an experience of meeting Shri Krishna. You have a strong detachment with your body which is found only in ascetics. However there is a difference. An ascetic would first settle Karma-desire accounts of his body so that when He/She goes to higher plane, no asurrah would try to hijack and use the body. You should love your body and realize that you have got this body due to certain pending Karma-desires. If you don't settle them first, Asurrahs would hijack your body and their Karma would get added in your account. That is why Shri Krishna is advising you to get married and settle the Karma-desires due to which you have got this body. When you start loving your body, the bad dreams etc will stop.	Blessings",

I was just thinking that chapter - 24 is taking a bit longer time, in the meanwhile, yesterday I saw your message that it's because of Assurahs.	Assurahs are everywhere. They influence our life too. We should try that our life shouldn't be influenced by Assurahs. For this, we need to connect to Lord Hanuman and purify our soul which we are doing or trying to do with the help of Setuu. Let's consider my case. I don't know how much I am successful or how much I implement in my life what I read on your website. But I am trying.	Only yesterday, I got to know that the delay in publishing chapter - 24 is due to Assurahs. Assurahs are creating problems to Mathangs and Setuu masters in publishing the chapter. Please correct me if I am wrong. And if I am right, then, my question is if Mathangs and Setuu masters, who are in direct service to Lord Hanuman and Mathangs who have got Brahm Gyaan directly from Lord Hanuman and Setuu Masters who take part in Sakshat Hanuman Puja, are not fully able to get over Assurahs, then, how can a normal person from mainstream society like me be able to get full control over Assurahs? I am just asking. Please forgive me if I ask anything wrong. Waiting for a reply.	Pranam to Mathangs and Setuu Masters.",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	At the end, the good side won and chapter was published.  Asurrahs are right here. They always put obstacles in the good work. It may take time but the good side always wins. This creation itself is a constant war between good and the evil. If evil is not there, there would be no creation as you know.	Only the enlightened ones realize how important chapter 24 is.  After one point, the realized masters face the situation where they lack words to describe the supreme truth.  Even great sages couldn't do it. Their words would become incomprehensible and generic after a certain point: like 'truth can not be described in words', 'we can only hint' and so on. Lord Hanuman has done what greatest Rishis in the past couldn't do. Chapter 24 describes what cannot be described. It describes the internal world which can be experienced/realized but almost impossible to describe. The attack of Asurrahs in publication of such words of importance is understandable.	Blessings",

A Guru may prescribe food preferences to a Sadhaka if he deems it necessary for Sadhana.  Garlic and Onion are known to be Rajasi food.  Sadhakas may be advised by the Guru to have only Sattvik food.  It completely depends on the Guru and the path he is designing for the Sadhaka. There is no universal rule.	A Brahmana, or the enlightened one, can also make his/her own rules as to how he/she wants to live life.  No rules can be imposed on the Brahamanas.  They determine their own rules.	Ram.",

Lord Ram encountered a lion and thought that how could lion be my reflection. Yes, the lion is very high variation of my reflection.	If you can find a mirror, that mirror is also the reflection of Paramatma. That is not the mirror where Paramatma is reflected. That mirror is just another reflection.

As it is said in chapter 23, there is nothing wrong in imagining about Paramatma provided that imagination promises to take you towards the experience of \"I am Paramatma\".	Whatever you have deduced and then expressed through these words won't help you drift towards the experience of \"I am Paramatma.\"  \"Main Body\", \"Universe born from...\" etc. imaginations shouldn't be encouraged. Use only and only the imaginations told in the chapter 23. May be Lord Hanuman will expound on it in upcoming chapters. But for now, just use the \"Mirror and Reflection\" imagination.

More you churn, more knowledge will come out.  Supreme knowledge is not like an academic knowledge which you receive in schools and colleges. Supreme knowledge is inside you. The words of Lord Hanuman will reveal that knowledge. Therefore, do not seek readymade answers.  If you have a query, think about it until you exhaust your thinking capability on that topic.

      question: "Dear Setuu Team	Jai Shri Ram Jai Sadguru Hanumanji. It was extremely delightful and highly insightful to read the latest chapter. I have no words left to describe to beauty of Sri Ram's mind which can perceive anything without any judgement/prejudice. Will look forward to more such chapters.	However I am having one clarification here. As I read the chapter more carefully, I understand that any amount of information will never suffice to make our mind clear of reality. Our mind will continuously evolve unlimited images as and when more and more information are pounded on to it on any given thing. it could be person/action of a person.	In such circumstances, If we have to react on a situation, or respond to a person on any given situation, or take action on someone for if that person's action has affected us, It would be very difficult to take a decision on reacting/responding to the situation because our mind would still not be knowing the reality. It could also lead to a scenario where our reactive / responsive action can create injustice to that person as Reality would never be rightly perceived.	I humbly seek clarity on this subject that how to be totally unbiased and still take the right decision in reacting/responding to a given situation.	I pray to Sadguru Sri Hanumanji in helping me in understanding this concept.	Waiting for your response.	Jai Sri Ram Jai Sadguru Hanumanj",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	This chapter, If understood, adds an information with every experience you would be having from this point forth.  And that additional information is, \"Whatever you see is not reality, it is just a version of reality as you see it.\"	This additional piece of info will change the way you respond to situations.	If somebody hurts you, you would be more forgiving and compassionate towards them thinking, \"I see that they have tried to hurt me, but that may not be the reality.\"	If somebody has done favor to you, you would be less attached to them, thinking, \"I see that they have done favor to me, but that may not be the reality. But I am someone who loves unconditionally, so I love this person regardless.\"  (Less Attachment means more unconditional love.)	This is how someone who is on the path of supreme truth responds to people and circumstances.  This is how sages interact with the outside world. So, this chapter ought to bring this quality of sages in you.	||Ram||",

In spite of worshipping Sadguru Hanumanji and Sri Ram, I am a very timid person. Personally I feel that I am angry sort. but my nature is very suppressible. I am unable to pull out the anger.	Example - These days Road rages are very common incidents. for no fault of ours we encounter some quarrelsome and highly abusive person who reprimands us with out any reason. I feel extremely angry at these things but my timid nature urges me to escape from such a scene and avoid confrontations and quarrels. Although once I am away from there, my body will be trembling with rage and kind of fear of consequences.	This holds good in most of confrontational scenarios like office, personal etc. After the incident for long time I remain disturbed and upset over my timidity. Thinking and rethinking of the consequences and the untold inconveniences, I avoid most of confrontations and quarrels with anybody. I feel that I am becoming week because of this.	I pray to Sadguru Hanumanji to mend my nature in this regard. I do not know how I can become fearless. Please advise me on building courage.	Waiting for your response.	Jai Sri Ram Jai Hanumanji.",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	When your body-mind does something which your soul doesn't approve, then body starts trembling/ behaving strangely.  Your soul doesn't desire conflict.  When Asurrahs residing in abusive people contaminate your mind, your body-mind gets enraged and your soul stops recognizing/accepting enraged body-mind.	Lord Hanuman cannot take your soul backward.  It has come to this level after many births.  Making it desire conflict means taking it backward.	The alternative solution is to make use of Asurrahs.  When you need to confront a person, let your soul fly away from your body-mind for some time.  Let an Asurrah take over your body-mind and handle the situation.  Then you will find yourself more courageous.  Once the situation is over, you may return to your good-nature self and your soul will come back.  But make sure that the Asurrahs do not contaminate you.  Just use them like a tool and throw away once used.	Blessings",

      question: "Pranam Mathangs and Setuu masters Is everything predestined or not? Do astrology and planets effect the lives of people? Bcoz the life we are experiencing right now is due to past karmas Bcoz if we take great people like Aadi Shankaracharya or Gautama or Ramakrishna paramahamsa When they were born planets are in extraordinary position That means planets effect humans lives They are born to show the right path to the humanity not to lead ordinary human lives Bcoz to my understanding what I understood was If jaya vijaya (Gate keepers of vaikunta) were not cursed Ramayana and mahabharata wouldn't have happened? Bcoz due to the curse of them they were born as Rakshasas and lord vishnu has to take birth and to kill them This is how their destiny was planned To take birth as enemies of vishnu in 3 lives and to be defeated in the hands of vishnu after that they will be back again in vaikunta Here there 3 lives was pre-planned In ramayana there are many people Said to ravana and vibishna also said that To return seeta back to Rama He didn't listen He didn't listen because due to his samskara? Or his destiny was planned to defeat under lord vishnu(Lord Rama)? And again in bhagavatam also When narada visited sage vyasa ashram, vyasa was unhappy Narada asked vyasa why he was so sad after writing the mahabharatam also then vyasa said I wrote 4 Vedas and 18 Purana's and mahabharata and iam still not satisfied My heart is bursting with grief O sage tell me a way to get peace? Then sage narada replied Though you have written all But you didn't write about Lord vishnu Who he is? Where did he come from? You should write all these Then you will be happy Mediatate on lord vishnu and you will know the whole story of bhagavatam Then you teach the whole bhagavata Purana to your son and he will teach to the king parikshit who is in fear of death (Here narada is saying that king parikshit will listen bhagavat Purana who is in FEAR OF DEATH) The incident happened when Parikshit went hunting. The King, after pursuing a specific prey in the forest for a long time, had become tired and hungry. This was when he came across the hermitage of rishi Shamika. Unaware that the rishi was under a vow of silence, the King enquired about the prey but the rishi answered not. Enraged by the rishi’s silence, Parikshit placed a dead snake on the rishi’s shoulder with the end of his bow. The rishi still did not protest. Observing this, Parikshit became repentant and walked away. The rishi’s son Shringi, who himself was highly accomplished in penances, came to know of the insult meted out to his father through Krsha, son of another rishi. An enraged Shringi cursed that the King will meet his death by the live snake Takshaka in seven days Though parikshit was a noble king but at that time he lost his cool and placed a dead snake on Rishis shoulders Is it happened? Bcoz as narada said it is destined to happen? Or is it happened Due to parikshits anger? Bcoz narada clearly says to vyasa that You teach this bhagavat Purana to your son and from him the first person who will hear this Purana is king parikshit WHO IS IN FEAR OF DEATH And It is said that Lord Brahma will write our destinies and he will fix our life span for some X years? When we go to some Astrologer by looking at horoscope he says that You will become this you Will become that You have this mahardasha running that running etc etc Some will happen some will not happen And lord Krishna in bhagavatgeeta said that In chapter 3 sloka 27 प्रकृते: क्रियमाणानि गुणै: कर्माणि सर्वश: | अहङ्कारविमूढात्मा कर्ताहमिति मन्यते || 27|| All activities are carried out by the three modes of material nature.

But when you come down to the level of humans and do an action, at that point you have the freewill and you have the power to shape your own destiny. When you are level with the Rishis, they are in middle of ordinary humans and Gods. They can see their own future from perspective of Gods, and can plan their actions at level of humans. When they do something, they get both the feelings. They feel that they are doing action at their own will and at the same time they feel that what they are doing is pre-destined. It happens at the same time. So their knowledge about future does not affect their freewill or vice versa. ||Ram||",

      answer: "Divine Soul,	We advise devotees not to try to do postmortem of dreams.  If it is a good dream and you do postmortem, you may waste an opportunity to realize that dream in real world.  If it is a bad dream and you do postmortem of it, you recycle your bad desires which may result in a bad reality next time.	Do not try to understand dreams. Just let them be,	Blessings",

      question: "Respected Soul,	I have some confusion about Shri Hanuman Ji “Puja Vidhi Process”.	As per Setuu website  Mathang use  mantra (Posted in Website) to calling hanuman ji.	But my soul   is thinking that this knowledge give to Mathang by hanuman ji for their worship or  calling.	Is it right if we use same mantra for calling hanuman ji ?	And in second hand In  Hindu religion (Very old religion) process of worship or calling is  totally different.	Many  very lucky  soul have got hanuman ji darshan  from Hindu religion.	Which (from both Mathang Style and Hindu religion Style) is right for worship and Dharshan of Hanuman Ji?",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	We have published only 3 lines of Mantra with permission of Lord Hanuman. After that we didn't get the permission probably because people were misusing the Mantra. We will release it fully if and when we get His permission. Most probably the devotees who sincerely read the chapters will be eligible for the Mantra. We suppose we won't get permission to publish it for public in general.	Hinduism consists of Guru Traditions. Mathangs is one of the Guru traditions, the difference is that here Guru is Lord Hanuman Himself.  Most of the Guru Paramparas have been lost.  If your family has its Guru Parampara intact, you should follow your Guru Parampara.	Blessings",

      question: "Jai Hanuman,	Sir, How Can I realise My Soul. Means How can we Know that this particular voice is our Soul voice or it is only my Mind Voice.",
      answer: "Divine Soul, Your mind may get thoughts from two sources - (1) Maya or the external world (2) Your soul. When your mind is directed by thoughts from your soul, you are on right path. Otherwise Maya has you trapped. To know if a thought is sourced from Soul or Maya, just find out whether it has been originated from something in external world or Maya. If it hasn't originated from Maya, it has come from soul. Now here is the tricky part. Originating and projecting are two different things. Your mind may get a thought from soul and then project it to be originated from Maya. Such a thought would be called right because it has originated from soul, but later got projected on Maya. You need to ponder and practice in order to be able to differentiate. Blessings",

      answer: "Divine Soul,	As described in chapter 20, humans create systems of classification for smooth functioning of society but these systems turn out to be faulty and have to be chucked or repaired over time. Firstly, no human designed system is perfect. Secondly, when times change, almost all systems get infested with social evils. No system is flexible enough to last forever. Current caste system is beyond repair.	To answer your question, caste of a person cannot be determined by birth.

I read in some articles on online, in which they mentioned that Ramayana written by lord hanumanji on stone surfaces of caves will be found before lord kalki going to take birth on earth. From that time onwards I was eagerly waiting for real Ramayana and what lord Vishnu wished to give message to human beings through his Leela's.	In that search I found answer for a query that how soul (rama) is trying to establish connection with body-mind (sita) when demon is trying to influnce body-mind. Similarly Agni pariksha and Hanuman's search for sita, and the way settu masters explained.	I am requesting setuu masters please provide Ramayana and Mahabharata in that form.

My most humble and heart full Pranaam to the Holy feet of our beloved God Shri Ramachandraji and Shri Hanumanji	I am grateful to your team to bring to us such a profound and rare knowledge from Our Lord and Sadguru Shri Hanumanji.	I am following your chapters very closely and am also reiterating my read on the chapters for deeper understanding on the subject.	In this quest while my repeated reading on the Chapter 13, I wanted to seek some clarifications. for which I am herewith writing to you. Please provide me the clarifications on my questions. Please do not take my questions as my audacity. I seek sincerely.	Question 1:	While reading the chapter on Linga Shastra I understand that - \"By Altering the Linga of a Soul, The body also changes to the same form as the linga is converted.\" Here I wanted to ask that if a body changes would the intellect/Consciousness/Chitta also change automatically, or intellect/Consciousness/Chitta has to be worked upon separately ?	The reason I ask this is that in the Chapter 7, Lord mentions that the consciousness of each specie varies. As he gives the example of a Monkey who sees the Sun and perceives it as a Fruit. and We humans perceive Sun As a Source of energy, Star or Ball of fire etc. So here I understand that the Every animal sees, understands, perceives the nature in its own way. In that case if the body of the being is changed then logically would the Consciousness change automatically or it has to be worked upon separately.	Please clarify this question.	Question 2:	Again, while reading the chapter on the Linga shastra I understand that - \"When all Linga is maintained with only positive light waves it assumes divine form and reaches Vishnu Loka. When its Positive and Negative light waves are in perfect equilibrium, I assumes the form of Shiva lingam and reaches Shiva loka. I was only curious to know what would happen if the Linga is maintained with Negative light waves?	[Please Note: As to Question 2, if Lord Hanuman Has deliberately avoided the point then you may choose to not answer the question]	Please help me in my quest of deeper understanding on the subject.

Will it know that  It is the servant of lord vishnu which is sent to the mortal world for some task ?\"	Plzz answer all the questions	Thank you",
      answer: "Divine Soul, It depends on the state of the soul. If you are selected for Sadhana at Setu Hanuman Bodhi, your soul is already evolved enough to attain Moksha in present lifetime. A soul which is trapped in materialistic world may take many births to get the spark which is required to start on the path of Moksha. That spark will come from within. Penance will be endured in the form of situations in day-to-day life. Suppose a person gets too much difficulties in life, it itself is a penance which can lead to \"spark\". Or suppose a person has achieved all heights of materialistic world and feels empty (Like prince Gautama who went on to become Buddha). For such a person, the easy availability of all materialistic pleasures itself is a penance. When that \"spark\" comes, then also the evil powers of universe (called The MAYA) will do everything to undo that spark. For example, suppose a person got the spark and went in search of a Guru. The Maya will play another trick and land that person into trap of a cult Guru. The cult survives on making a soul feel inferior and wretched. To ensure lifetime subscription to the cult, the cult Guru will declare, \"Moksha is very difficult You have to leave attachments and penance for long years. And after that if you start in this birth after many births you will get moksha.\" Such a soul will remain trapped in the illusion that it is following the path of \"spirituality\". But actually it would be doing the bidding for Maya. State of such a soul is worse than an ordinary materialistic soul because it is under the illusion that it is following the path of Moksha, but actually it is doing the opposite. You don't need to go to Himalayas but you certainly need to give up the 'ego'. By ego, we mean the 'sense of I'. If you can do that while living in materialistic world, it is fine. But it is harder to do so in society, and easier in mountains. That is why we require the Sadhakas to come here in the mountains. Moksha means merging into Muktisagara. But some souls fail to attain Moksha and get stuck one step short. Then they land into VishnuLoka or BrahmaLoka or ShivaLoka. When you are sleeping, your soul is in SwapanLoka. But if somebody, say, causes pain in your body, your soul immediately tries to come back to the body to protect it. Same is the case when your soul goes to MuktiSagara. If any pain is caused to your body, your soul may try to jump out of the Muktisagara again. The pain can be caused in many ways. For example, if you leave a body soulless, some Asurrah may occupy that body and start using it for evil means. Or your 'alive' body may start rotting thereby causing the pain and agony in the body. (The body should be properly cremated and ashes should be dispersed.) Or if somebody deliberately kills the body, it causes pain and increases nett evil power of the world. To avoid such a situation, a soul from VishnuLoka comes and occupies the body. Sometimes the task assigned to the 'visitor soul' is just to occupy the body till it's natural death. That is a passive task. The soul passively does welfare of the world by keeping Asurrahs away from that body. Sometimes it is assigned an active task. For that an advanced 'visitor soul' comes to the body and becomes a reformer of society etc. No, the soul doesn't know that it is on a task assigned by Lord Vishnu. That ensures that they do their task properly as an ordinary part of the world. But these souls are easy to steer clear from materialistic world. They do not accumulate additional Karma. So they don't get stuck in the cycle of birth and death again. They only accumulate desires which can be easily washed away after death of body. They don't need to take another birth. They return back to VishnuLoka. And sometimes, they even get Moksha after completing the task (as it happened in chapter 14).",

      question: "Namaste!!	My salutes to the Supreme Being Lord Ram, Lord Hanuman and all the Divine setuu and mathang souls!!	(1) As a child I always wondered who I am and why I am, what the universe is and why there is happiness or sadness. I have anticipated for some of these answers from some point in my life, I dint have a peace of mind at all after that. My existence din’t make sense to me. Everything around me stopped making sense. I yearned for the answers, an invisible force guided me to my answers, it was like the universe was putting me in places to get me the answers, which led me on to the spiritual path. And it was this force that led me to setuu website. It is a blessing from the Divine Lord, I got peace of mind after I started reading the words of Hanumanji himself from these chapters. I always felt getting lighter or nothing at all after reading a chapter. My friends tell me I look much more happy now. I see the difference in me, I am not who I was. I am lighter, more happier and  complete than before. My heart felt gratitude to setuu masters, the whole mathang community, Lord Hanumanji, Supreme Lord Rama and the entire universe for this Divine work. Thanks you!!	(2) Most of the questions I had have been answered, but I have a few more questions. Kindly, answer these questions for me. It has been explained by Hanumanji in previous chapters, how, why n when souls raise out of Muktisagar, but what was the first instance of a soul raising out of Mukti sagar and how could it have occurred? There would have been no suras and asuras then, how could have people generated good/bad karma? When did the first kalpa happen? How did this cycle of kalpa come into existence? Shukracharya, asuras and all good and bad come from the supreme lord himself. He is the creator. He must have lead to the start of all of this. What is the purpose of all these? Is this a plan for a greater progression?	(3)In previous chapters, Hanumanji said there are several worlds and each of the worlds are different and some are higher (shiva loka, vishnu loka, Brahma loka) and only the worlds closer to our world affect us. In the recent chapters, he said we have many parallel universes co-existing at the same time. What is the exact relation between these worlds and universes?	(4) The world around me and every aspect of it is very much real to me, and that is what is conveyed when end of kaliyuga is mentioned, but Hanumanji also says it is all an illusion/maya. If its only an illusion, it should be modified in a second right? Why does the Supreme Lord have to come down himself to change things? Then, is the maya described only individualistic, restricted to the way one perceives the world, and not including all aspects of existence? Are the effects of maya on an individual soul and the collective consciousness different? If an individual breaks free of this maya and attains liberation, the world would still continue to exist as it is, but does this single soul leaving effect the world anyway? I am not able to comprehend the extend of the maya. Can it me explained further? Or, is my the thought process flawed here? my mind expects a start and end to everything, it wants everything to be linear, is this an aspect of maya,  and I am not able to perceive the truth beyond the constraints of the mind?	(5) I have been meditating for past 9-10 years and I had these instances in life, when I have foreseen or fore-thought something happen and it happened. It was a different state of mind, a more grounded and connected state, thats how I perceived it. But, I never could fully get a control of the state. These instances happened more when I meditated regularly. But then, when I stopped the meditations this skill vanished away. I understand Kamadhenu cow such a state of the being, or the state of the realization of maya. Am I right? Or, am I misinterpreting these instances?	My apologies for such long para, and for the poorly framed questions. I couldn’t put them in a better way. The whole idea of maya is elusive to my mind.	Thanking you in advance,",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	In MuktiSagara, concept of TIME doesn't hold. So 'first' or 'last' doesn't make any sense in Muktisagara's perspective. For example, your soul can go to Muktisagara now and see an event which happened millions years ago (from human perspective) happening in MuktiSagara right now. We humans are used to concept of 'Time'. You need to go beyond Time to be able to witness events happening in MuktiSagara. From human perspective, there is no first. It is a cycle. There is no end and no beginning. You may find a beginning only to discover that it is just another point in the cycle. You may stop exploring and call something a beginning. But if you keep exploring, there is no beginning.	You have read about higher worlds wrongly. Shivaloka, BrahmaLoka and VishnuLoka are different. Patala and Vyahritis are different. Lord Hanuman has called 'Vyahritis' as higher worlds and 'Patalas' as lower worlds. Only 7 Vyahritis above us are perceptible to us. Only 7 Patals below us are perceptible to us. For sake of our observations, we can say that there are 7 Patals and 7 Vyahritis. But actually they are infinite. To visualize this, you may imagine that you are in a mysterious room which has doors in all 4 directions + doors on the ceiling + doors on the floor. You can exit from any door and you will get into another world. And there is no end thereafter. You may keep on going and you will find no end. If you exit from the doors in the ceiling, you are going higher. The worlds which exist beyond those doors are 'higher worlds' or vyahritis. Similarly the worlds which exist beyond the doors in the floor are called Patals or lower worlds. The doors in the 4 walls of the room lead to parallel worlds.	\"the words you have written in paragraph 4 should be meditated upon deeply by you. These are divine words which show that you were in a very high level of consciousness when you wrote them. Here is a hint which will help you in sailing in correct direction : Suppose you do not have any identity. You are in complete darkness. Then you happen to find a box. You open the box and discover a identity and whole universe which comes with an identity. Within a second you start identifying yourself as a human which is in MaanavLoka where Lord Vishnu is expected to come for welfare of the world. When you close this box again, you again lose everything and go into complete darkness. You forget about humans, MaanavLoka, Lord Vishnu and everything. You are in that box right now. Lord Vishnu is the power which helps you realize that you are in a box. You have written this paragraph by the blessings of Lord Vishnu. If you manage to come out if this box, it will be thanks to Lord Vishnu. Coming out of this box means attaining Moksha.\"	Kaamdhenu is when you don't come out of the box but get the ability to jump from one box to another.	||Ram||",

      answer: "Divine Soul,	At least 6 months of Sadhana is required to be eligible to attend Sakshat Hanuman Pooja. It doesn't require an ordinary sacrifice. You need to sacrifice your own 'identity' or 'ego' or 'sense of I'. This is most difficult sacrifice for a human being. Anybody can sacrifice materialistic possessions but sacrificing who you think you are is what is required to meet Lord Hanuman.	Blessings",

      answer: "In the above statement, who is \"I\"? What if that \"I\" is no longer there? This very idea of 'not being there' frightens this \"I\", isn't it?

You can become rishi Being rishi is being in heaven is being in heaven because a rishi can fulfill any desire without doing any Purushartha 	That means rishi can doing anything	If you solve this puzzle you will get all  the powers which all Rishis have and become rishi	But being in this material world It is very difficult to find an solution with the limited human minds And it is said in 18 th chapter Don't be trapped by your mind go beyond it	So it is very difficult to find the answer with the normal human brains	My question is if i come to setuu Hanuman bodhi And have Sadhana How many years will it take to solve puzzle and  become rishi ? Iam asked with my normal  human mind Iam sorry if am I asked anything wrong	Waiting for your reply",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Within 6 months of Sadhana, you will drop the idea of 'becoming' anything. Most souls choose to depart from this mortal world (for Moksha) once the realization happens. That means, your soul will depart from your body and it will be replaced by a 'visitor soul' from Vishnu Loka. That soul may choose to become a Rishi to complete the tasks assigned to it by Lord Vishnu.	Blessings",

First of all I convey my heart felt thanks and regards to the sadhakas who have answered my quest and guided me through it.In the above following experience i.e the answer to this you have mentioned that An Invisible Guru is guiding me,and that he is very near to me.You have also mentioned this fact that a Guru knows when his or her disciple has to go through a conflict and have peace.When I read about this and looked back at my life I found that whatever pains or turmoils I have gone through has made me a better person.

Will He or She ever be visible to me? How do I get to know of the instructions?Could you guide me on this.	Jai Sri Ram",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	A Guru need not have a intelligible form. If you can sense His presence, that is enough. You have to be wary of the assumptions though. Sometimes, a seeker may make assumption that their invisible Guru is giving them signal to do something. That may not be true. Don't make assumptions. Just follow your natural course and do everything as per your Dharma. When you feel Guru's presence, just take a breath and fill your heart with gratitude. And then resume your natural course.

      question: "Jai Shree Ram Jai Maa Jaanki Jai Hanumanji	First of all, I bow my head to the holy feet of Lord Hanuman.	I have been following this website for almost 2 years now. I have been following all your guidelines which you tell me either in the section Setuu Speaks or through email.	I want to ask you what is the proper or correct way to worship Lord Hanuman i.e. How should I worship Lord Hanuman?	I do Pooja everyday. I chant Hanuman Chalisa once or more everyday and Sunderkand on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Most of the times, I read Sunderkand in one attempt but sometimes I do read it in parts. I also read Bajrang Baan on Tuesdays and Saturdays. I chant Sri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram everyday. I also go to a Hanuman temple on Tuesdays and Saturdays and read Hanuman Chalisa, Sunderkand and Bajrang Baan there in the temple. Sometimes, I chant Lord Ram's name and Goddess Sita's name too in the temple. But sometimes I do skip reading Sunderkand and Bajrang Baan on some Tuesdays and Saturdays due to shortage of time and sometimes may be because I really don't feel like reading. I don't know the reasons behind my not reading Sunderkand and Bajrang Baan for the second reason. May be at those times my mind is captured by Assurahs or what I don't know. Also, while being on a tour or journey or when I am at some other place, I couldn't do my Pooja. Does this make Lord Hanuman angry?	Now, please tell me if my way of worshipping Lord Hanuman is correct or not? Am I worshipping Lord Hanuman in a correct way or not? If not, then, please tell me the correct way of worshipping Lord Hanuman.	Please answer as soon as possible. Waiting anxiously for your reply.	Pranam to Mathangs and Setuu.	Thanks and regards.",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	A glimpse of how Mathangs worship Lord Hanuman is given in chapter 6 and 7. But when you ask them the correct way of worship, they would ask you to follow your family tradition of worship and not copy others' traditions, not even Mathangs'.	Find out your family history. There must have been a Rishi associated with your family in ancient times. Usually your last name may have a hint of your family ancient Guru. Find who He is and what rituals He set for your family. Unfortunately most people have lost their ancient family documents. We cannot help them retrieve their ancestors' documents. We can only suggest you to ponder on one of the chapters of Lord Hanuman's Leelas during the worship. This will compensate for the lost family rituals.	Blessings",

      question: "Respected Setuu masters,	\"what is moksha? It is said that when a soul gets \"\"dissolved\"\" in MuktiSagar, it does not remain the same soul. When a new soul comes out of the MuktiSagara, it has no relation with the soul which was \"\"dissolved\"\" in it earlier.\"	That means soul dissolving in Mukti sagara is called moksha	\"But my question is what happens to the soul which has got moksha? I understand that it dissolves in mukti sagara\"	\"Does it have a feeling that it got moksha I mean will the soul knows it got moksha? If yes what feeling it will have? The everlasting joy?\"	\"If  it doesn't have feeling that it got moksha Then what is the use of getting moksha?\"	Because it doesn't know it got moksha?	Or Moksha means another separate world which is present down in the mukti sagara?	I didn't understand what moksha exactly means?	So can you please tell me clearly	\"And who gives the Moksha Lord Shiva or Lord vishnu? Bcoz you said that Moksha means dissolving in Mukti sagara which is lord vishnu's abode\"	But when Shiva gives Moksha where will the soul dissolve?	In Shiva loka or vishnu loka?

      answer: "Divine Soul,	Your this query makes it evidently clear that you are not into spirituality, you are in the illusion of spirituality.

I never got along with the girls i had gotten engaged to. I was so upset and depressed due to the family pressure, that I always prayed to Lord Shiva and Durga Maa to get me out of this mess that i was in. And all of a sudden both my engagements broke. and i was out of it.	Does God listen to you when you really want something or get out of something like my case, If my marriage has happened i would have been in a deeper mess than i was in.	is it my karma that i have to face marriage obstacles in my life.	Please if you can initiate some kind of Pooja or can ask the Mathangs or Lord Hanuman about my query.	Once again my love to all the setuu Masters who have started this website and posting all of Lord Hnauman Leelas.	Please send my Love too all  the Mathangs and Lord Hanuman	Love",
      answer: "There are two kind of prayers - (1) Prayer for well being of body-mind (physical world) (2) Prayer for well being of soulYou need to figure out which kind of prayer yours has been and change the course to get your desire fulfilled.	If you believe that being in that 'mess' could have ruined your happiness but could have helped you in evolving spiritually, then certainly your prayer was for well being of your body-mind. Gods fulfilled your desire and saved you from mess but you got deprived of an opportunity to uplift yourself spiritually. Now if you pray for well being of your soul, your marriage issue will be resolved but it may result in a mess which will be helpful for spiritual realization.	If you believe that the mess could have ruined your chances of spiritual upliftment, then certainly your prayer has been for well being of your soul. Now you should change your prayer to well being of your physical world in order to resolve your marriage issue.	Blessings",

      answer: "Divine Soul,	We place no restrictions. But once you complete Sadhana, it is highly unlikely that you would want to lead an ordinary life in mainstream society. Sadhana takes away your limited identity and gives you infinite identity.	However, if during the course of Sadhana, your soul gets Moksha, your body shall be occupied by a pure soul from Vishnuloka which we call as \"visitor soul\".

      answer: "Divine Soul,	It only means that you have deep desire to meet or see Lord Hanuman but that desire doesn't have matching Karma right now. Therefore, that desire cannot be fulfilled in MaanavLoka. Lord Indra purged that desire in SwapanLoka.	That holds true for dreams. Sometimes, humans experience out-of-the-world things in semi-awake state. That is completely different. In this time and age, the outer world illusion is so powerful that soul doesn't get Lord Hanuman's message when body-mind are active. Then Lord Hanuman does something to deactivate body-mind for some time and push them to semi-awake state to deliver his message to the soul. That message may or may not be deciphered by the body-mind but it gets delivered to the soul nonetheless. Those messages help a soul in following the right path.	Blessings",

They clean up your desires so that you live a 'normal' life in this world. If this drainage system gets blocked, you may face issues which are labelled as 'psychological diseases'.

By the grace of my Lord Sri Ram I have improved in some of the areas of my life like losing the 'ego sense'.I was in the teaching field and now I just don't feel like talking,teaching or explaining anything to anyone.I have come to a stage of 'I know nothing' this feeling is getting stronger day by day,every hour every moment.

Kindly put this question in front of Lord Hanuman if this is the right thing for me.	Regards	Jai Sri Ram",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Working in corporate sector demands engagement of your body-mind. You lose your connection with your Chitt and soul.	Working in Ashrams or orphanages helps you find your lost connection with Chitt and soul because there you do not need to engage your body-mind too much.	If you are inclined to work permanently in an orphanage etc, you are basically switching your job to the one you really like to do. When you do what you really like to do from heart, your mind goes through less conflict.	When there is less conflict in mind, are there more chances of spiritual upliftment? The answer is no and yes. Sometimes a seeker has to go through conflicts to recognize the illusion and sometimes a seeker has to cut off from the conflicts so as to spend more time in pondering and meditation. Only a Guru can guide when a seeker needs peace and when he/she needs to go through conflict.	A Guru is guiding you. He is invisible but He is very much near you. Listen to your inner thought and take a plunge accordingly.	If you do not have family responsibilities, you may opt to volunteer with Setuu. For that you need to submit your experience in detail. Write about yourself, your soul relationship with Lord Hanuman and what you have learned/unlearned from each chapter of Lord Hanuman's Leelas published here. Then we will consider your application for Sadhana. You will get to volunteer for Setuu at different stages of Sadhana.	||Ram||",

      answer: "Divine Soul,	Your current state of evolution is such that you would want to run back to the society within 1 month of obtaining Sanyasi robes. You need at least 6 more years in mainstream society to find yourself and your purpose. Living in mainstream society with unusual and 'far from ordinary' tag is itself a Sadhana. Don't run away from this Sadhana. Face the people who are saying mean things about you. Face the society which is out to judge you. When you do this Sadhana, you will actually realize the illusion.

      question: "Respected sir, Jai Shree Ram, I wanted to ask whether during the course of a day, our soul changes it's level , eg. If theres something one wants to do, which is deemed wrong according to sanskara that one has received, and before he does the said thing, he is even reminded of his sanskara, but he anyways does the thing.. The question is whether he ascended to the level of sanskar prithu(or he had the option to) when the thought came and then descended to nishad level once he didnt listen to his inner voice. In this way, each day do we ascend and descend to various levels depending on how we choose to act?? Also sir, As imbibed from the knowledge,everything Im experiencing right now in an illusion, including this universe, lets say all of us have our own universes, when we interact with each other, it connects our illusions/universes too and the illusion only deepens.. So is the 'truth' the only thing that spreads uniformly across all universes(billions of them) and makes them one through the truth/the divine?	This knowledge we receive through Hanuman Ji makes us realise, thats because we can feel it through our aware conscious, what about animals and trees sir?.. Animals and trees must be having their own 'trishanku universe' too but they can't realise..OR their perception is different(as Sun to Monkeys)  Does that mean animals have no right to attain Moksha?.. They live at deh nishad , does that mean they can't be elevated?.. OR are plants already evolved enough? Cz plants don't seek pleasure or food, they primarily give.. Pls enlighten sir. Jai Shri Ram	P.s. Seeking blessings from Lord Hanuman, Namaste O:) putting all of my faith in him and believing in the Supreme and the Supreme knowledge as the only truth..  Ram Ram Ram",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	If a person is Samskara Prithu in morning and Deha Nishada by evening, he is considered a Deha Nishada for that day. If a person is Deha Nishada for Krishna Paksha of a month and Samskara Prithu for Shukla Paksha of that month, then we will classify him/her as Deha Nishada for that month. In any time period, the lowest category a human being falls to is the category he belongs to for that time period.	If a person chooses to ascend and descend as per convenience, he/she is a Viveka Nishada. Most human beings fall in this category in this time and age. In fact entire course of society is being set today by people who call themselves \"Intellectuals\". These people are found in TV studios, newsrooms, and entire mainstream media space. They can twist arguments as per their convenience. They are 'Viveka Nishadas'.	When you wrote the line \"So is the 'truth' the only thing that spreads uniformly across all universes(billions of them)\", you imagined an entity called supreme truth. But that is not truth. That is just another object of illusion. Supreme truth cannot be imagined. Supreme truth doesn't stretch from one point to another. It is just there is. You are astounded by massive size and shape of illusion. You imagine that there are billions of massive universes bound by a single string called truth. When you evolve further, you will realize that one particle of sand also has those 'billions of universes' inside it. You will stop being astounded by the size. Because size is just another illusion. When all these instruments of illusion - size, color, number etc. - cease to astound you, they will drop like superficial layers, and what all will remain would be truth - bare truth.	You are not a human being. You are a soul. There are two things - your soul and outside world. Your body is part of outside world. Imagine a huge bed-sheet on which lot of shapes are printed; shapes of humans, trees, mountains, animals and so on. If you want to touch the bed-sheet, you have to hold it from somewhere. If you hold from an area where human shapes are printed, you identify yourself as human. But actually you are a soul. You can hold the bed-sheet from another place and identify yourself as something else like a tree or animal.	This world is a multidimensional bed-sheet. Your soul has to clutch it from somewhere. If it clutches it in 'human area', it identifies itself as human. There is no 'They'. There is only 'I'. \"I\" is the tree, 'I' is the animal. There is nothing but 'I'.	It is good that these questions are arising in your mind. It will be easier for you to absorb what He wants to impart to you in upcoming chapters. Let these questions squirm and shake the ready-made notions in your mind.	Blessings.",

That is my problem, I am not able to open my inner eyes. Everybody waits for spark to motivate themselves in spiritual life, but I think I need FIRE(lol).	Secondly, I have heard from the elderly about kartaviryarjuna as a person who will get back our lost things. There is a shloka which is recited by the person who has lost/ misplaced things and then he gets it back. How is it possible? How is it that our elders Incorporated shloka of a person who has fallen to lower level of existence. When he has not been able to help himself how and why are we??????????",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	A loss of any kind is an opportunity of enlightenment. The shlokas you are talking about don't beget you your lost things. They only help your loss turn into an opportunity. When Kartavirya lost his way in jungle, Rishis gave him the opportunity to elevate himself. They revealed the secret of Rishi community to him.

      question: "Dear Setuu, Sai Ram Jai Hanuman Accept my humble pranamas. I read about Urmi's soul flying out of the body and Ram Narayan occupying it to fulfill his desire to be with the family. So my question is the popular idea of saying s/he is possessed is also the same way. Here in my place there are practitioners who do \"\"Samohini\"\" -something like...they send say Me to trance and ask me to see in my body for any other souls residing in that body. They also help in seeing the past births. O I got the word it's called past life regression. Back to my question so in case of urmi can we say she was possessed? 2) can more than one soul reside in one body? 3) How are Baba, Mata, Urmi, Urva, Basantha,.........and other mathangs? Convey my pranamas to all of them. 4)Very important question, how to realise and utilise the potential of soul? Hanuman says don't interpret or respond to the senses. I need a little more 'How' explanation on this. (this is not arrogancy. Please consider as ignorance and forgive me if I have asked anything wrong)",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Understand the core concept of 'flying out of body' from chapter 5 and 'possession' from the local practitioner. Then you are the best person to judge whether they are same or different. From the way you are describing, probably the body of Sulochna  in chapter 14 can be called as 'possessed'. Urmi left the body at will, and as per the plan of Lord Hanuman. It cannot be called as 'possessed'.	Yes, more than one soul can reside in one body. One would take the driver's seat and another one would take the backseat. It happens very often in fact. Most people have their driver's seat occupied by a Surrah or an Asurrah and their own soul remains in the backseat. They don't even realize that their body is being driven by a Surrah/Asurrah.	Supreme knowledge is the only way to utilize the potential of soul. Unfortunately, seeking a ready-made answer for 'how' can only get you 'information' not 'supreme knowledge'. The pursuit of 'how' gets you supreme knowledge, not the 'destination'. Collect honey like a bee does. Don't buy a bottle from market.	Blessings",

      question: "Dear Setuu, Sai Ram Jai Hanuman Accept my humble pranamas. I am reading this probably 2time. The layer of illusion seems to get shaken now. I felt this is a gradual process as the soul has taken many bodies and got bound by karmas and desires. So in that case your 108 hours of arpanam is insufficient. Simply because there are chances for people like me to take time to understand it. 2) I am still not clear whether mathangs are monkeys or humans. If you want to know about me, well than I look like human but am monkey in side.(no intentions to compare with mathangs or other wise monkeys) 3)in bhaghavat gita Lord Krishna says all things in this universe are fragments of me. So is going back to mukthisagar should be the goal or going back to the lord(merge with him) 4)are mukthi and moksha two different things?",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	You may follow your family tradition for Arpanam. We have been instructed to put in place the Mathang tradition which calls for Arpanam within 108 of reading the chapter for first time. It is like breaking coconut. It is considered best if the coconut is broken in first attempt.	Mukthi and Moksha are the same thing. We cannot influence your soul's goal. There are thousands of souls who prefer either Shivaloka or Vishnuloka over Moksha. But as described in chapter 13, Moksha is the ultimate destination for a soul. (Actually it is something where all destinations end. So it cannot be called destination.) To be able to get Moksha, one has to let go off their identity. That is what is difficult for most souls. Suppose you are given two options - (1) A trip to Paris (2) A trip to heaven. The condition is that you cannot carry any luggage. You get excited. Of course heaven is better than Paris. So you would choose heaven. But then the flight attendant tells you that you cannot carry any luggage. You frown at her and say, 'I have no luggage.' and then the flight attendant says, \"Your body itself is the luggage\". Then you will probably freak out, turn around and run away as fast as you can.

First of all is it necessary to guard?(as seen in chapters they only seem to put souls in an endless desire and karma)",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	In this age of ignorance, everything has been messed up. All the ancient scriptures have been distorted. Here is a case in point.	There is a Jyothish Acharya. He is doing experiments. He is trying to superimpose data related to positions of planets on the data related to conditions of human life. After crunching all the data, he figures out that there is planet \"X\" whose positions determine influence of Asurrahs in human life. He concludes that nature of planet \"X\" is somewhat like that of the Asurrah Guru. For sake of memorizing, he names this planet \"Shukra\".	Then he figures out a procedure to minimize the influence of planet \"X\" in human life. He calls this procedure \"Shukra Pooja\".	Centuries later, some fools with addled minds but high authority mess it all up and conclude that this planet itself is the Asurrah Guru.	Supreme knowledge is the only guard against Surrahs/Asurrahs. When you become aware enough to differentiate between your own actions and the actions of Surrahs/Asurrahs, you are guarded. Then you won't mistake their actions as your own. You won't own up their misdeeds.	Blessings",

In my experience your answer just touched me, i will made more effort, as you only helped me to realise me about Maya, but i most live in samskara prithu level because i have to do my responsibility, and am just 21yr old, i cant interact with people to the level i live with myself which u called chitta or atma prithu, i remember that feeling, and try to experience it when am alone or when i have to take important decisions. . Well i want to clear one doubt, what is Siddhi..?? In the page history of mathang i found this. . Why Lord Hanuman's original footprints are visible till date at this place? Because this is the place where Hanuman attained 8th and last Siddhi which is known as Ishatvam. Thus He attained all 8 Sidhhis by his deep devotion towards Lord Ram. When He landed on this hill and found Mata Seetha there, He was overjoyed as He was able to accomplish the task given by His master (of searching Mata Seetha). In joy He closed His eyes and remembered the lotus feet of Lord Rama. As soon as He closed His eyes, He had an amazing experience. It is impossible to describe this vision of Lord Hanuman in words. In almost all the versions of Ramayana known in India, Thailand and other places, the poets have described it as a vision which only the supreme lord Shri Ram can describe. Words cannot describe that vision. The 8th Sidhdhi i.e. Ishatvam is said attained when Yogi becomes One with the Supreme. Though Lord Hanuman had deep devotion and surrender towards Lord Rama, It is at Seetha Eliya that He experienced oneness with Rama- the supreme lord. That is why the chapter of Ramayana which describes the meeting of Lord Hanuman with Mata Seetha (called Sundar Kand in Valmiki Ramayana) is said to be the greatest chapter. . When Renuka Ma attained Godhood, she attained the eighth level, And here The Hanuman ji too attained 8 siddhis termed as Ishatvam. I dont want to ask question on it, because i dont know what is siddhi, i want to read from you its meaning and relation if any. . I didnt used any special character now . Thank you",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	The journey between Aatm-Prithu and Godhood has many milestones. In one of the system of classification, there are 8 such milestones which are called Siddhis.	Blessings",

Please help me forgive and forget my bad memories.	Please pass my humble queries and prayer to Lord Hanuman.	I'm helpless I keep thinking about people who used to like me I am not sure whether they really like me or not because of them I had problems however when they stop liking me just because they think I'm in happy place is it my fault or there's? I hope Lord Hanuman helps me get over bad memories	Jai SRIRAMARAMARAMA !!!!",
      answer: "Divine Soul	(1) You should not feel any need of approval of others on your relationship with your God. If it feels right to your soul, it is right. The traditions set by Rishis in general may be overruled by the traditions of the family set by the family Guru/ancestors. And traditions of family can be overruled by the devotee if their soul is connected with the Lord.	(2) It is nobody's fault. Human relationships of Kaliyuga work this way only. If you are in a bad position, your relatives/friends will desert you out of contempt. If you are in good position, they will desert you out of jealousy/misunderstanding. Focus on the only relationship which is true: Your soul's relationship with the supreme.	Blessings",

Pls do inform in Sakshat Hanuman pooja. Lord Hanuman Pls fulfill MY desire Regards --------- Dear Setuu and Mataang friends How do I differentiate between my mind and my soul.....everytime my mind says something I think my soul is speaking....I am bit confused....Pls help Pls ask Lord Hanuman about one incident It was 11th April 2016....one of my colleague,  a devotee of Lord Hanuman was going to a bank to transfer some cash to his sister in Gurgaon....me and another colleague was accompanying him....and we were in kolkata city....on the corner of the road there is a beautiful poster of Lord Hanuman & 4 lines were written in Hindi....we could decode 3 lines but couldn't decode the 4th line....on the arrival of the first colleague who was Lord Hanuman devotee came and helped us decode the line and said that it was a part of Hanuman chalisa. ...it was about 3pm.....at approx 5pm he got a call that his brother had an accident @Mathura @approx 3 pm....the person was on comma for about 10 days or so....hospitalized with brain clot and operated limb for about 20 days...now he is discharged though he is yet to recover his memory. ...I somehow see a link of Lord Hanuman in the entire episode in saving his life.....though not clear why did so serious accident happen at the 1st place.....can you pls inquire and let me know...",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Seek the source of an experience. Seek to know the observer, not the observed. Its like cinema hall of Maya. Don't indulge yourself in what is playing on the screen. Instead look out for the projector which is projecting those illusionary images on screen.	Level1: For example, you are reading these words right now on a device (computer/mobile). Here the 'observed' is the words you are reading. Find out who is the 'observer here'. Your mind?	Level 2: Immediately after reading the above line, you have risen to another level of observation. Now you are not only reading these words, but also trying to look at the one who is reading these words. So basically your observation scope = The observed + the observer of level 1	Level 3: Then you can rise again and find out who is the observer at level 2 so as to make your observation scope = The observed + the observer of level 1 + the observer 2	You keep rising like this. Then you will be able to clearly differentiate between the soul and the mind.	Blessings",

      question: "In around August 2003, i came back from delhi, where i went to prepare for certain exam. it was slightly raining and then electricity went kaput...we all were trying to sleep. I was lying on one corner of the bed while my mother was lying on another side. Just two of us in the room.while I was sleeping...my eyes were shut..I was lying on bed...I saw the room in which I was sleeping ...I saw a dark girl ...who was of about 12 to 13 year old ...wearing a skirt and top...which I used to wear as a child...she entered in my room through an open door and sat next to me while I was sleeping... And then suddenly I felt wave formation in my body...3 times...and I woke up. I went to my father immediately and narrated it...He said it happens when u r half asleep and half awake. It wasn't a dream...It wasn't a waking reality. ..what was it... And who entered my body...me or that girl? Before this incident only significant dream I had was of kali matas image.it happened just the night before I was leaving for delhi.It was like a huge poster of goddess kali and that was all and nothing else...There was nothing except her...and there was no movement in that dream...nothing just a kalis image. This dream did bad for me because In all things I started to desperately seek signals from mata and wasn't applying my intellect. I had this trust in my dreams because of this one particular dream may be in 2001 or 2002. .I was trying to save a badly injured dog, his one eye had come out. While I was doing whatever I could to heal him...I had this dream...where I am cooking a kheer. I started cooking kheer in the day, in the dream I am stiring it ...now it is evening and when I stop to look at the kheer the milk is spilled. I woke up and immediately I knew that dog won't survive...It died the same day In the evening. After this dream I started to believe in my dreams. I have had few more significant dreams but right now I am curious about that dark girl who was she?",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	It is unfortunate that even after reading all the chapters, your mind is buzzing with this query. Dreams are dumping grounds of your unwanted/unfulfillable desires. Do not bring them back into MaanavLoka reality by thinking about them or trying to find a meaning behind them. This approach has cost you a lot in your life and you are still not giving it up. Don't let your Swapanloka reality drive your MaanavLoka reality. If you read experiences of other devotees related to dreams, and the answer they got in Sakshat Hanuman Pooja, you would be able to understand how desires become recipe of dreams. We always advise devotees to never think about dreams, especially bad dreams, after waking up.	Blessings",

      question: "Shat Shat Naman	I'm of age 30 years & I have some queries in my mind. Till now I have read all the chapters published in setuu.org.	I have been born and bought up in a environment  where studies were given utter importance, so in accordance to that my parents have dreams that they see in their child, but a child I failed to deliver.As the time passed by, so do I kept performing karma. I believed in lord Sai Ram & devoted myself, but I keep asking for wishes from the lord, but they were never fulfilled. Then I thought may be I'm not good enough that Lord Sai Ram will ever fulfill my wishes & even got angered from lord & assumed that lord will never pay any heed to my voice. I turn to lord Hanuman ji & started devoting myself. But sometimes I promise lord Hanuman that I'll not do few things & I broke the promise and does those things, which I believe makes lord Hanuman ji take his eyes from me .Now since we are trapped in Maya, but in this Maya world as a mortal human being I have some duties to perform. One of the duties are to make my parents proud by my achievements (which I failed to deliver). I prayed to lord Hanuman ji to fulfill my wishes, which I think wont be fulfilled since I failed as a soul to devote myself fully to him.So whatever I do whether its studies or pray or devotion, I actually failed. As a soul I'm unable to connect to Lord Hanuman ji. I'm completely blank now to as what I want to do, what I want to achieve in my life.	I do recite Lord Hanuman ji name everyday but not whole heatedly. I also know whatever I do I cant win the heart of Lord Hanuman ji & can never be his devotee although I wanted to be.	Also If my wishes are not fulfilled I ll keep asking for them to be fulfilled & remain trapped in maya world forever	Setuu please guide me since I'm highly confused to what I want to do in my life. I read teh chapters once or twice , they leave their impression on my mind for a day or two, then I go back regular course of life & obeying to Maya world rules",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	First of all detach yourself from your body-mind. You are a soul. Not body-mind. Let the soul witness activities of body-mind. Even if body-mind does something wrong, don't let that leave any impression on your soul. This way, you can keep your soul pure even when body-mind is not pure. Slowly, you will see that your body-mind will also start falling on right track.	When your soul is pure, you can connect with Lord Hanuman, no matter what your body-mind are up to.	Another thing, keep everything between your soul and Lord Hanuman. Don't bring your family or society in between. There are millions of people around you. When you start living as per their criteria, you in effect put burden of millions of suffering souls onto your soul. Figure out what you want to do in your life. You means your soul. What is your higher purpose? Don't let 'making parents proud' become your purpose. It should only be a side product of whatever you do. Don't bring your parents' Karma onto your soul. Free yourself from attachment. It will benefit you as well as your parents. Remember, attachment is not same as love. Attachment complicates things. It adds up others' Karma onto your soul while love frees you.	Figure out what you like to do and do that irrespective of what your family or society expects. When you follow your own goal without bringing others into picture, Lord Hanuman will certainly help you. You will achieve your goals and happiness of people around you will be a side product.

      question: "Shree Ganeshaya Shree Ram Shree Hanuman . I am sending my experience via email because of the error. I was having a question deep hidden but i didnt knw whether it was a valid question or not.. . The question was, a soul has a desires karma system to follow and rise above them to get Moksha, if there is swapnlok where all The desires get purged by Indra deva, so there must a loka where we can purged our karma, yes manavlok helps to settle the karmas but that illusion of kaliyug is so dense that sometimes evolving souls doesn't evolves because of illusionary knowledge, worldly responsibility etc. . In chapter 18, Hanuman showed us that there is another universe which is identical to manavloka, if there is no kalpa cycles there then it should help a soul to be bound free from there karma and rise above this illusion, i dont know what am saying, my words for me seems pointless as both are illusion but .... . Another theory i am thinking on is.. . If its trishanku's universe there then it is a illusion for a body named trishanku who see a whole universe identical to manavlok, means his soul is trapped in a simulation type bubble, where everything exists, there. at first i imagined that it would be a whole new universe with exact planetary system, exact galaxy, etc but i questioned myself again, and realised that every soul is trapped in a bubble of simulation made by Maya, which can be seen, feel, and interacts too. It thats a trishanku universe he is living in.. then i am too living in my own universe, which i can call it Prasad's universe. I have to conserve my universe unto my karma settled and desired fulfill... Is this theory i am experiencing ..is right..? Plz guide me if i am wrong..! Please solve this point for me....! Thank you. .	I want to ask one more thing, as a reader lord Hanuman has already make that puzzle of Kaamdena Cow easy for us to solve, the name kamdhenu is Indra, and the word Cow here is Satyuga, that means in ashram they have a cow which means satyug and the kamdhenu fulfill the desires and modify thought and anything..	Is this right? Did i really got this puzzle? I know that i am not Rishi now but i am doing some acts which believe me that i am in the initial stage of Prithu or this idea is just illusion for me,? Am i not evolving though?",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Our technical team has informed that they have debugged the issue faced by you. You were not able to post experiences because you have a habit of inserting a smiley in your experience. Due to security reasons, our website is designed to throw error when an unrecognized character is inserted in content. Try to post the experiences without smiley or other special characters. You will be able to post. If the problem persists, please email us again.	You are posting experiencing after a long time which, not surprisingly though, have worked in your favor. Many devotees want to flush out thoughts as soon as they start aching the mind. You kept your thoughts with you for a long time and as a result, we see that you have evolved significantly.	Your experience shows a curve of evolution. First part of experience shows that you are at Samskara Prithu level. Your use of phrase \"if there is no kalpa cycles there\" shows that you didn't get chapter 18 properly. Are you sure that there is a Kalpa cycle in Maanavloka? How can you be sure that it is not merely an illusion sitting in your mind? How can you be sure that this is Maanavloka, not Trishanku Loka?	Second part of your experience however shows that you jumped to 'Chitt Prithu' level while writing this experience. (It could even be Aatm Prithu level). 'Prasad's universe' is an excellent thought process. Keep this path and you will arrive where you should.	You haven't got the Kaamdhenu puzzle yet. But you have drifted towards solving it.	||Ram||",

('Reaching' is not right word to use with Moksha but we can use it just for the sake of this analogy.) From that track you are not able to see your destination but you are able to see/experience some other things/beings/powers. You learn that those things/beings/powers are called Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Hanuman and so on.	Now there is another track parallel to yours. Another person (Lets call him 'M') is running on that track. He also cannot see his destination. But he can see/experience some other powers and he calls them Allah, Koran etc.	Both of you are happily running on your respective tracks and hope to reach the final destination.	The illusion/Maya is watching both of you from the sky. (Just an analogy, Maya doesn't live in sky. She is everywhere.) She doesn't want any of you to reach your destination. She plays a trick. She manages to put a thought in mind of 'M'. M gets desire to chat with you so that he can pass time while moving towards his destination. M says, 'Hey whats up... What do you see in front of you?	You reply, \"I see Shiva.\"	M says, \"It seems you are on a wrong track... Because I see Allah... and I am pretty sure that I am on right track.\"	Then you try to convince him that he is on wrong track, not you.	Finally both of you deviate from your path. You leave the correct path without even realizing.	M' starts walking on a path where the destination is 'Convincing you', not 'Moksha' or ultimate destination.	You also start walking on a path where the destination is 'Convincing M' and not Moksha.	Maya manages to deviate both of you simply by playing one trick.	The moment you start comparing your experiences with the experiences of people running on other tracks, you get deviated.",

Does it exist parallel to us or like Patala Loka and Vyahriti Loka it exists above / below?	2) Urva asked the Lord that are we in ManavaLoka or Trishanku's Universe.

The Lord can plant any kind of thoughts in our mind, and even if we are in another reality, He will make us believe something else. Kindly enlighten about the answer.	3) Lord Hanuman said that the nature of Trishanku's world is exactly similar to Manavaloka. But do there exist Rishis, Gods and all ? Does that world conform to the rules and regulations set by the Gods ?	4) Rishi Vishwamitra's experiement resulted in Satyavarta's soul entering the new body called Trishanku.

      answer: "Divine Soul,	Chapter 18 is a milestone in the journey towards Moksha. This chapter is meant to raise queries in seeker's mind. When Urva got query, Lord Hanuman just smiled. He didn't answer. It means that seeker should just ponder and churn out thoughts at this stage. Here is how the thought process of the seeker should be:	Does every soul has it's own universe in which everything else is just an illusion and only one soul is real? Your mind may reject this thought right away. But keep this thought alive. It doesn't mean that this thought is correct or incorrect. This thought will give you momentum on the path of Moksha. This thought should lead you to a puzzle similar to this :	Imagine you are born with invisible glasses on your eyes. When there is a \"Red\" thing out there, these glasses show it \"black\".	Suppose your friend is wearing red shirt. He says \"How is this red shirt I bought recently?\"	You will reply, \"This is not red, this is black.\" [Because of the invisible glasses.]	Your friend will say, \"Are you mad? This is red, not black.\" An argument will break out between you two. You will go to third person. If third person sees it as \"Red\", your friend will be proven right and they will advise you to see a doctor. If third person sees it as \"black\", you will be proved right and your friend will be declared 'mad' or 'colorblind' or something like that.	Now comes the illusion.",

      answer: "Divine Soul,	Yes, permission is taking longer than usual for chapter 18.	Yes, experiences are processed before and after Arpanam. But Arpanam sent by a devotee has no relation to whether his experience will get replied to or not. If experience is sincere, we process it in Sakshat Hanuman Pooja. The screening team has no way to know whether the devotee who has submitted an experience sent Arpanam or not. They only have access to data of time spent by devotee on each chapter. Screening of experiences is done based on that data and the sincerity of content of experience.

      question: "Hello, Hanuman Chalisa had been written at around 16th Century.. Does Mathangs also offer prayers through hanuman chalisa..? Its just written in 16th Century.. so was there any other method before to pray before that to Hanuman ji..? Does Hanuman ji talks about hanuman chalisa and its importance in day to day life..? Please throw some light on Hanuman Chalisa..	Thank you",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Until Treta Yuga, people could see Lord Hanuman in the Ashram of their Gurus, or randomly in mountains (away from mainstream society). There was no need of Mantras. Only a desire to meet Him was enough. In Kaliyuga, humans lost their contact with Lord Hanuman. Guru tradition was still there. Every caste/category of humans had a Guru. Those Gurus used to discover/realize (through Lord Hanuman) Mantras which were applicable only for the caste/category that Guru belonged to. That too disappeared. In the time around 16th century, communities had no Gurus. So Lord Hanuman revealed a general Mantra called Hanuman Chalisa to a sage. Because it was revealed by lord Hanuman Himself, it became famous across various communities.	Now is a very different Time. Now people are too much into visuals, very less into words. Visuals are vehicle of illusions, word is the vehicle of divine. So the word (Hanuman Chalisa) is not effective for people who are too much into visuals. Why?	A devotee in 16th/17th/18th/19th century could chant Hanuman Chalisa and visualize Lord Hanuman's Leelas as per his own vision. So even though Hanuman Chalisa was only general Mantra, each devotee had a unique manifestation from this Mantra.	Now when you chant Hanuman Chalisa, your mind visualizes scenes from various TV serials/movies related to Lord Hanuman. Those TV series/movies are not created by any sage. They are created by ordinary film makers. So your visualization of Lord Hanuman's feats is adulterated by visualization of a single person (director/writer of movie).	Perhaps, that is the reason Lord Hanuman has made His Mathang Leelas public. May be through the words being published through Setuu, people can connect better with Lord Hanuman. These words are so powerful that visuals of TV serials don't fit in mind of reader. So the reader visualizes a unique visual of Lord Hanuman. Probably this is the Time in Kaliyuga where combination of Mantras and Supreme Knowledge is necessary to connect with Him.	As far as Mathangs are concerned, they have their own Mantra of 36 lines. They do not chant Hanuman Chalisa. We had published 3 lines of this Mantra but after that Lord Hanuman did not give permission to publish more lines. Either people misused these lines or they pronounced them wrongly. Lord Hanuman will give permission to publish these 36 lines if they are meant to be for all devotees in general. Let us wait.

      question: "No one remembers their past lives..? would it not have been easier if we would have remembered our past lives and desires, we could have fulfilled them very quickly and could have Moksha.. Just wondering about this...If we could carry our past lives desires.. why not memories..",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Memories are like people. In this world (as you know it), there are millions of people. 4-5 of them are living in your home, some hundred living in your neighborhood, some thousands in your city and so on. What will happen if all the millions of people start living in your home? It will be disaster. Distance is there for a reason.	Same is the case with memories. When a memory is 1 day long, it is close to you. When months pass, it goes away from you. What will happen if all the memories remain fresh all the time? You wont be able to handle them. Even if a single bad memory of past becomes fresh again, it gives immense pain. How can you handle millions of fresh memories?	Blessings",

      answer: "Divine Soul,	Black magic can only create issues which relate to soul's connection with body. Had it been black magic issue, it could have been resolved by now by Lord Hanuman. This is related to complications of Karma and Desire. It is one of those situations where Lord Hanuman has to choose between welfare of her soul or body. For Lord Hanuman it is like choosing between Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. In most cases, He chooses Lord Vishnu (Welfare of soul over body). In some cases, He may choose Lord Shiva (welfare of body over soul).	In any case, His blessings are with you	||Ram||",

      question: "!! Jai Shree Ram ! Jai Jai Hanuman !!	I was reading some questions posted by devotees of Hanuman ji and their answered given by you. One question it was asked that reading Bajrang Ban is not good and you replied that reciting his name in any manner cannot be wrong.	I have one doubt and question here In bajrang ban there is one line which give vow to do someone work, I don't think it is right, It is also true that no one can black mail him on the name of his lord but it is not right to complete any task by giving shree Ram's oath to hanumanji. Being human, we also get frustrated, irritated or angry when anyone give oath of someone to do a job and specially if we don't want to do it. So how can we think to give oath to Maruti. I think it is not right. I love him and cannot give oath to do any job.If he think that this is good for me he will do if he think it is not good for me he will not do. Then why demand and demand for what ? for this world which is not real.	Agar kuch aisa hain jo main samajh nahi paya hu to kirpa kar mujhe samjhaiye. Apki bahut kirpa hogi.

Maruti bas kirpa karna aur satbudhi aur sanyam dena. Dheeraj dena, kripa dena.	Dene ke liye bas bhav hain mere pass mere mitr, kabhi aao aur seva ka moka zaroor dena.	Apko shree Ram jald hi mile, ye dua hain meri apke liye. Apne prabhu se bichadne ka dukh janta hu main.	Jai Shree Ram ! Jai Jai Hanuman",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Any kind of reciting is done for purpose of connecting soul with Lord Hanuman. Once the soul is connected, Lord Hanuman only does welfare of the soul. He never does any harm to the soul, no matter what you have recited to connect your soul with Him.	However, when your soul is not connected with Lord Hanuman, your prayers are handled by Lord Indra. Lord Indra doesn't have any agenda of doing welfare. He is just a fair distributor. He just looks at your Karma and Desires and gives you pain/pleasure accordingly.	If your soul is not connected with Lord Hanuman, and Lord Indra gives you pain, you may get an impression that Lord Hanuman has given you pain. But that is not true.	",

He has to answer my question.	Pranam",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Prayer does help. It helps a lot. But the prayer cannot be done by the body or mind. You are a free entity. You can come to level of body, mind or stay at higher levels of Chitt and Soul. Most human beings live at the level of body and mind. When you fear about your future, worry about circumstances etc., you are at the level of body-mind. At that level, you cannot do prayer. At that level, you express only fear and lower desires. Those desires are heard by Lord Indra, not the higher Gods. If you want to communicate with Lord Hanuman or other Gods who live in the realm of soul, you have to rise to the level of soul.	There can be many ways to rise to the level of soul. Some people can rise simply by chanting 'Ram', or any other Mantra. Or you can read a chapter of Lord Hanuman's Leelas to rise to the level of soul. When you try to express at the level of soul, you never express your fear. You will just remain silent. Only words which may come out of your mouth would be 'Hey Ram' or 'Om'. You will never express your materialistic desire at that level. When your soul connects with the supreme, prayer automatically happens. And that prayer does bear materialistic fruits also. At that level the soul expresses desire of Mukti. And to fulfill that desire, Gods have to settle down your worldly conflicts first. So they work to either settle down your worldly conflicts or design them so as to give you lessons.	Also, find a higher purpose in life. Materialistic desires get fulfilled when you are not desperate for them. Let your actions be driven by the higher purpose. Your higher purpose could simply be \"to find happiness in every moment\". Take it like a game. You have a puzzle of life in front of you and you have to locate happiness in there. Find reasons to be happy in every moment.	Solitude is good but not loneliness. If you have disconnected from people to avoid their reactions, that is not good. Meet people just for the sake of testing your spiritual evolution. If somebody shows pity at you, just see if it hurt you. Then rise above that hurt. Witness how you respond to people. Just imagine yourself having a basket in which you are collecting experiences. Imagine experiences as flowers. There are different kind of flowers. Keep collecting them. 'Somebody showed pity at me' (put it in the basket), Somebody jeered at me (put it in basket), Somebody talked about me behind my back (put it in basket).	You have a choice- you can either get crashed by the circumstances or use them as steps towards spiritual evolution.	Blessings",

      question: "I sincerely thank you for providing us a platform where we can obtain such values and knowledge,  it has been extremely gratifying to read the chapters. These have started providing meanings to many things that I often left un noticed.	I wanted to ask one question and hence am posting it here. Is it alright to curb one's anger always? I am posing this question as I acknowledge the positivity of being calm and kind and I always endeavour to be kind as well as true to all people with whom I interact. Even if I am angry at some actions, I understand that such actions originate from mistakes people make inadvertently and explain to them or respond to them with utmost care and being kind to them. Often during nights, I wake up abruptly with a feeling that I am not able to recognise where I am. this feeling lasts for few seconds and these seconds are very difficult. Sometimes I am so apprehensive during these moments that I don't even recognise my spouse or family members sleeping nearby and as a response try to push them away from me. I am sharing this here as I don't want to harm family members sleeping besides me inadvertently. Their sleep cycle also gets disturbed because of me. By observing these incidents, my closed ones suggest that since I don't get angry with anybody , these emotions try to come out during night while I am asleep. I don't remember the dreams because of which I get awakened (and I now understand from the chapters that this is a very good blessing and attribute; also sometimes the dreams are not there and I just wake up). The feeling of not being able to realize where I am happens immediately after waking up. It will be very helpful if some insights can be provided such that I can overcome these.	Thank you again for being a setu between hanuman ji and several of us; I keep sharing the anecdotes from the chapters with my family members for helping explain several things and situations in our day to day lives. I sincerely hope that they also start reading the chapters.",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	That is an Asurrah. Though it must be made clear here that having an Asurrah trying to enter a body is not at all an abnormal thing, at least in Kaliyuga. We are living in an age where Asurrahs are so many in number that it is rare to find a person whose body-mind is not being used by Asurrahs. In fact, there are multiple Asurrahs in a single body-mind these days. Most people don't even realize that they are being driven by Asurrahs.	Asurrahs enjoy evil activities- for example misunderstanding between two people, fight, dislike, hate, pain and so on. They try to spark such activities and then sit back and enjoy the evil. In your case, you have protection of Surrahs. So when your soul is in your body (when you are awake), Asurrahs don't get any chance to do evil acts through your body-mind. You don't even give them the simplest pleasure of anger. So they try it when your soul is away in the SwapanLoka. As soon as your soul realizes that an Asurrah is trying to enter your body-mind, it rushes back and the Asurrah flees away.	In such a situation, understanding of your loved ones is most important. If your loved ones get annoyed because of this activity of Asurrah done through your body, Asurrah will feel that it has become successful in sparking an evil (i.e. annoyance). Then it will linger on and try to spark some bigger evil. Asurrahs are like ants. What is sugar for ants is evil for Asurrahs. When one ant finds a grain of sugar, it informs entire colony of ants that there is sugar available. Similarly when one Asurrah finds an opportunity of doing evil, it invites all the Asurrahs of its group to create bigger opportunity of doing evil.	If you start getting angry, you will provide opportunity to Asurrahs to use your body-mind in daytime. That is like placing some sugar out of the kitchen in hope that all ants will go there and won't come in the kitchen. That is not the solution. To get rid of Asurrahs, show them that they don't have any opportunity to create evil through your body-mind. (1) Don't get worried yourself otherwise that Asurrah will think, 'Wow, I have created worry. Let me try to create something bigger through this body-mind'. (2) Make sure your loved ones don't get annoyed otherwise Asurrah will think, 'Ah, I have created annoyance, let me try to create something bigger.'	Take it as a simple thing which doesn't bother you. Eventually the Asurrah will give up and flee away.	You may have seen in TV etc that Asurrahs are scary creatures. What we are referring to are not those Asurrahs. If you want to visualize Asurrahs, visualize them as ants. So, take it easy. There are plenty of Asurrahs everywhere searching for 'a grain of evil'. Don't give them the pleasure.	Blessings",

      question: "My grandparents living in india constantly have to face troubles created by my aunt. She does black magic all the time but my grandparents don't believe in it. They don't believe that she does it which is the biggest problem. By doing black magic she nearly killed my grandad once. And now again she keeps on doing something or the other and doesn't let them live in peace. She does this so that she can get the property. Please pray for my grandparents and us so that we don't get affected by black magic and please.",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	First they have to accept that there is a problem. For that they have to come out of their illusion. We have initiated prayer for this.	Second, they have to be detached from the person who is doing black magic. That is possible only when they accept that there is a problem.	You have very little to no control over what your grandparents go through. They are independent souls with their own Karmas to settle. More you tell them that there is black magic going on, more they will be delusional about it. They have to realize it by themselves. Don't try to convince them.	Blessings",

      question: "Rama Ram Ram	I submit this query after a lot of contemplation whether to ask and how to post this query etc.	My question is even if I chant Ram Nam regularly, why dont i get any sort of guidance from within or from some other super natural sources.	What ever i do or think or decide to do, everything goes waste or in other words, my actions and efforts give the opposite reactions and results. Why????? I start with lots of confidence and positive thoughts and with good energy levels and what ever is needed for the particular actions - Then too they go in vain.	WHY?????	I need some guidance - for what to do - when to do - or how to !!!!	How will i get the proper guidance??????	When will I get success in my life??????",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	You are not getting success because you are desperate for it. You are not at peace with your present, how can your future be peaceful and better. For instance, you haven't read even all the chapters of Lord Hanuman's Leelas published here. You don't do anything with patience because you are not comfortable with the way you are right now. You want to run away from your present. See, what you currently are right now is a sum total of your Karmas and Desires of past. You have to accept your past and present, then only future can be better.	Don't chant Ram Nam just for motive of fulfilling desires. Chant it with your heart. First realize who you are? Are you a piece of blood and flesh which has some desires. Or are you something higher than that? Contemplate.	Blessings",

      answer: "Divine Soul,	Follow the \"One Step Up\" rule. If a voice is coming from somewhere, just go one step up and try to witness the voice. For example, suppose a voice is coming which says, \"Enjoy, life is short\", then go one step up and try to witness the source of this voice. Ask the question, \"Who is saying this?\" If you are able to watch the entity which is saying this, it is not the highest point i.e. it is not soul. It is just one point between the outer mind and the soul. You may not be able to name it but you can feel that it is not the highest point of observation.	If a voice is coming and you are not able to witness that voice from a higher point, then it may the the voice of your soul.	Blessings",

My career is also not going good enough and I don't want to become burden on my family. Last thing at what age I will die.",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	If God intended to let humans know their future, all humans would have taken birth with the ability of knowing future. Future is told only when it is required for healing purpose or when the person whose future is foretold is highly detached from body and the world around.	Suppose we tell you that you will get married on so and so date. It will give you a kind of comfort. That comfort is not different from comfort of consuming addictive things. This will ruin some more years of your life and things will get more complicated. Hasn't it happened like that so far in your life? You have always sought validation from others of yourself. You have never discovered your own inner strength.	We would like to tell here that the prediction part of astrology should be taken only as an entertainment in Kaliyuga. At least in mainstream society, there is nobody left who is not influenced from Asurrahs. Even Lord Vishnu is not able to find even a single household woman who is free from Asurrahs so that she can be eligible enough to give birth to Lord Kalki. In such a situation how can you rely on someone who is telling your future? That person's mind may be influenced by Asurrahs. And Asurrahs enjoy misleading people to create chaos and disorder in society.	Therefore stop taking the prediction part of astrology seriously. If somebody is foretelling good about you, just take it as a compliment. If somebody is foretelling that bad things going to happen, take that as a criticism from an enemy. That is it.	Take charge of your own life. You are a soul and every soul is powerful enough to transcend into supreme soul. Discover your inner strength. Then everything will start happening as per your wish.

It's my urge to you, Please guide me!	Pranam!",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Surrender and let Lord Hanuman handle it. Probably attachment is the reason Lord Hanuman is not able to apply remedy. If you read chapter 3, the woman was so attached to her child that the remedy was impossible to be applied. So Lord Hanuman got the Vaayu Deva to make her believe that her child is dead. When the attachment broke, the remedy was applied.	In this case, probably you are attached too much to your family members. Love and attachment are two different things. Surrender yourself to higher power. Deaths in the family should have caused the attachment to break. But instead it has increased in your case. Seek the supreme truth and surrender. You cannot apply any remedy. Let Lord Hanuman handle this. Give Him favorable environment to apply the remedy.	Blessings",

      question: "Dear Setu Masters, Many thanks for guiding people like us to reach Hanumanji.  Reading some chapters did make me feel light. Some chapters kind of gave rise to many questions and doubts. Maybe an ignorant soul like me cannot comprehend such information.I have been a devotee of Shri Sai baba for as long as can remember. He is Vishnu, Hanumanji, Shiva, Shrimata for me always. Through dreams or incidents, he has always encouraged me to read Vishnu Sahastranamam and Hanuman Chalisa. I religiously read these every day.  I always felt a connection with Hanumanji from then onwards.I have always prayed to him (Sai baba) to help me get rid of all my Graha Doshas and Kalsarpa Doshas and attain peace of mind. Few days ago, I had a dream in which he was performing Poojas and chanting Mantras. After the Pooja was over, he said all my Doshas have been nullified.  The dream ended there. Again after a few days, I had a dream in which two young boys approached me and asked me to take part in some Pooja with them. I had flashes of Mantras (as though printed on a book) they were chanting, but they are still unclear. After the Pooja was over, the boys turned into Hanumanji and Shiva. They blessed me and disappeared.I told my close friend about the dream and she advised me to read SundarKandam.  I am still unclear as to what I should do. I feel they are directing to towards something but I am not able to follow it.  As I was searching about Hanumanji on the internet, I came across this website.  Somewhere deep in my heart I feel they were directing me to Setu Masters and Mathangs.  Can you please advise? I read almost all the chapters published. Some did give me peace of mind while others left me a bit agitated.  I am an ordinary person. I have no insight about high level spirituality or soul, being a part of this illusionary and materialistic world. I know this process is not easy and is very time taking. What is the most effective way to begin the transcendence of body to soul and letting go of all materialistic desires?  I always feel there is a war like situation inside me; as if an asur has taken over me and the fight is between my soul and the asur. This situation always leaves me in pain mentally.  I get angry with slightest provocation and have no control on my mind. Even though I know there is nothing to get angry, a part of me tells me to calm, while another part is unable to do so.  I don’t know what to do.  Can you please advise as to what I should do?Regards,",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	We usually advise devotees not to postmortem their dreams. We advise them to forget the dreams because the meaning of dreams is too complicated to comprehend for an ordinary devotee. If wrongly comprehended, it leads to more complications. But you seem to have a good intellect, therefore we shall elaborate on your dreams. Hopefully, you will comprehend it correctly.	First of all, be very clear, when you desire something deeply but that desire has no way to be fulfilled in \"real world\" at the point you want it to be fulfilled, then Lord Indra is forced to fulfill that desire in SwapanLoka.	For example, you desire that you should have a child by the end of 2017, and you desperately desire so, but Lord Indra doesn't find any way to fulfill it in real world, then He will fulfill it in Swapan Loka or the dream world. That means, you will see a dream that you have become parent. You are able to remember that dream or not, it is another matter. If you remember it, your desire gets renewed and you still have chances of getting your desire fulfilled in real world.	But this is a very simple example. Usually, humans express desires in complicated ways and therefore their dreams have very complicated origins.	For example, recently a devotee wrote to us, that she gets dreams repeatedly which have a common template : she sees that she has an exam and she is not able to make it on time in the examination center. The template remains the same, the exact dream varies.	The origin of her dream was a desire which even she isn't aware of. She has a complex that she never meets deadlines. She has a complex that she is always late. She has this constant fear deep in her consciousness, \"I am not going to make in it time.\"	Fear is a form of desire. So this fear translates to this desire, \"O God, I SHOULD NOT be able to make it on time.\"	She fears it constantly. So she desires it repeatedly. Desire is like a token. Suppose you buy a token from a food joint. The waiter has to bring food to you for that token. Once the food is served to you, you go and buy another token. Then the waiter has to bring you food again. Then you go and buy another token and the waiter has to bring you food again for the new token.	Most humans keep fearing so they keep desiring. That is like getting the token again and again from the counter. Lord Indra has to fulfill that token (read desire) every time you buy it.	Same was the case with that devotee. She used to constantly fear it and therefore desire that, \"O God, I SHOULD NOT be able to make it on time.\"	If she has a project in hand which has a deadline, Lord Indra would fulfill her desire in real world. That means, Lord Indra would put obstacles and make her late. She misses the deadline of that project hence her desire/fear gets fulfilled by Indra.	But what happens when she doesn't have any project with a deadline but the desire is there? (because she constantly fears). Then Lord Indra has to fulfill her desire in Swapan Loka. That is why, when she doesn't have a deadline based project in hand, she sees this dream that she is getting late.",

      answer: "Divine Soul.	We would advice you to not recite the Mantra right now because we have come across some instances where devotees have recited it wrongly. First we will publish the entire Mantra of 36 lines along with the pronunciation. Then you can recite it anytime. It will help you connect to Lord Hanuman provided you are (1) in solitude or in company of evolved souls (2) evolved by way of reading Lord Hanuman's Leelas.	Body and mind cannot be connected with the supreme soul. Only your soul can be connected to the supreme soul and when it is connected, it becomes aware of Surrahs and Asurrahs. Then also some Surrahs and Asurrahs may use your body-mind, but you would be aware and won't own up their acts as your own. Therefore, there acts won't affect you.	You have taken birth due to combination of pending desires and unsettled Karma.	Blessings",

And once the souls attain Moksha (leaving the karma and desires and also understand that there is no 'I'); they enter Muktisagara.

Illusion of Brahmaloka being so powerful pulls the souls out of Muktisagara 2. Souls developing desire 	My questions are:	 1. Are there any other reasons for souls to leave muktisagara? 2. How does a soul develop desire Muktisagara since it will get all that it needs within Muktisagara itself? 3.

      question: "At the moment of the end of the kalpa few souls will get mokhs, few will be surrah and asurrah, what will happen with others like animal, insects, plants etc?",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	There are two things associated with each soul : (1) unfulfilled desires (2) Accumulated Karma.	To purge the unfulfilled desires, Lord Vishnu is not needed. When Time is up, Lord Indra can take your soul to SwapanLoka and purge your all unfulfilled desires thereby cleaning your soul as far as desires are concerned.	For settling accumulated Karma, Lord Vishnu is required. The souls trapped in human bodies would be worthy enough to be attended by Lord Kalki. So their Karma accounts will be settled. Some will get Mukti, some will get 1 Kalpa of Surrah and Asurrah role.	To get detailed knowledge of the fate of souls who would be trapped in animal bodies at end of Kalpa, please wait for upcoming chapters.	A simple understanding of their fate is the following.	They will get their desires nullified by Lord Indra by way of taking them to SwapanLoka but their Karma accounts will remain unsettled. They will be then present in Satyuga only for the viewing pleasure of the Surrahs. The lion and sheep will drink water from the same pond as they would have no desire of their own. They will act according to the Sattvik desires of Surrahs.	After end of Satyuga, the Asurrahs will come to earth and start evoking evil desires in those souls and they will start exhibiting their animal nature again.	Blessings",

When your mind absorbs that information, you tend to fly out of horizons of mind. Those words are called Brahm Gnan or the supreme knowledge.

To what extent these scriptures are manipulated? Are these reliable to know supreme knowledge?",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	The words of Gods have been adulterated by too many human minds. Only a realized master can absorb the words of Gods from these scriptures and filter out the human words. Therefore, if you have to read them, read under guidance of a realized Guru.	Blessings",

Chapter 16 was blissful. Guruji till now of all 16 chapters only for 2 chapters (chapter 12,16) I felt some lightness in soul but not for others,is it fine? I was in bliss or different world till chapter 13 but after this I felt lot of disturbances.	Due to rough situation in life since young age my tongue has become very bitter. I tell people whatever comes in my mind without thinking and my mind justifies my action saying that \"its good as I am a straight forward person\" but deep in my heart someone keeps telling that I need to change my nature.	The one person I hate in this world is my \"mother in law\",no matter what I do, I am UNABLE to forgive her.I have tried various methods like yoga,bhakti etc to forgive her but always FAILED in my all attempts till date.I keep bad mouthing her everywhere,friends,family,colleagues etc.I tried controlling my tongue,mind etc but no success. please suggest me something that can be understood by me.	pranam from my heart",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	For a householder, it is fine to have absorbed 2-3 chapters out of 16.	About forgiving, you must realize that you aren't doing any favor to anyone by forgiving them; instead you are doing favor to yourself. If a person is trying to harm you by any means, you must cut off from that person immediately in order to render him/her ineffective. Forgiving is a way to cut off from that person emotionally. As far as attachment is concerned, hate and love are same things. If you hate someone, you are attached to that person emotionally. And when you are attached, you can be harmed. Therefore, forgive them not for them but for yourself.	Also, practice silence. Speak to people only when it is necessary. Let your words be precious jewels. If you speak more than required, you are inviting trouble for yourself. Words spark troubles. Speak less, listen more.	Blessings",

      question: "\"Jai Shree Ram Jai Maa Jaanki Jai Bajrangbali\"	First of all please accept my sincere pranam.	I have read chapter-13 very sincerely 4-5 times or rather more than 4-5 times and I have some questions.	Lord Hanuman asked Dhanushka why has his soul chosen this small and fragile human body out of mountains, rivers, stars, planets, the matter we can perceive and the matter we cannot perceive? Does this mean that mountains, lakes or trees also have souls?	Lord Hanuman told that with the formulas of Linga Shastra, human could be transformed into a bird, a bird into a stone and so on. Well, human can be transformed into a bird but how can a bird be transformed into a sone? Human and birds are living things but a stone is a non living thing. Can a living being be transformed into a non living being? Does non living thing like a stone also have a soul?	It is mentioned in the chapter that even after destruction of all Karma and Desire, ‘the sense of I’ still remains. The sense that ‘I am a soul’ has to be destroyed in order to attain Moksha. A soul has to destroy its identity and merge with the whole. But you have always told that don't consider yourself a body because you are a soul, not a body. You have always told that you are a soul, not a body. This is quite contradicting. Please forgive me if I interpret something wrong. If I consider myself a soul, then, how can I destroy the sense that I am a soul in order to attain Moksha. How can I (a soul) destroy its identity and merge with the whole? How can I attain Moksha? This is somewhat confusing. Please clarify.	The present age is the age of Kaliyug. When did Lord Vishnu send Varaha to Manavloka and when and how did it take the form of stone and was called Lord Venkateswara?	Sage Bhrigu told that in Kaliyug living beings would have maximum lifespan of 200 years? Is it so? Because normally human beings have a lifespan of around 60 to 70 or 80 years.	Last but not the least, it is mentioned at the beginning of the chapter that 13th chapter is 13th step towards Moksha. This step is extremely important. Some blessed and lucky souls may get the ladder from here and get enlightenment. Those who don’t get the ladder will continue the step by step journey through upcoming chapters. Now, my question is how will someone know that he/she is the blessed and lucky soul and he/she has got the ladder and got enlightenment? How will someone know that he/she didn't get the ladder and will continue step by step journey through upcoming chapters? I have also read this chapter sincerely many times. So, now, how would I know if I am the blessed soul and I got the ladder or I will have to continue my journey step by step? Please answer.	Please answer these questions of mine. Please do not skip any question. Waiting anxiously for your answer. The question related to 'the sense of I' and the sense that 'I am a soul' is very important. How can a soul destroy its identity and merge with the whole? Please answer it in detail.	Thank you Setuu. Thank you Mathangs. Regards.",

Who will suffer the consequences of his demon, spirit or body.",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Desire and Karma both belong to soul. Body is just a tool used by the soul to fulfill desires. Whatever the body is used for, the soul has to bear the Karma.	Probably you want to ask, if an Asurrah is responsible for the evil deed, why would soul have to bear the Karma.	That is right. If the soul is aware that the evil deed was done by asurrah,the soul doesnt have to bear the Karma. However if the soul is unaware and owns up the evil deed done by the Asurrah, that evil deed leads to other evil deeds actually done by the soul and thus the soul has to bear the Karma of follow-up evil deeds.

Now my question is how can I accept lord Hanuman as guru when already i have accepted shirdi saibaba as guru. wont it be wrong? because people say that we should never change guru,s.	is there any other way of praying to lord Hanuman without considering him as guru.	Please bless me.Please convey to lord Hanuman that I will abide by his plan.	bhagwan ki sevika",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Your choice is limited to be a seeker. When you seek supreme truth, the Guru automatically walks into your life. You don't have to define that Guru and say 'He is my Guru'. Because Guru can be 1 person, a combination of people who come into your life at different stages, or an invisible power, or life itself. You have to concern yourself only being a seeker of truth. Let Guru manifest itself in any form it wants.	Blessings",

      question: "How do I categorize a good karma from a bad karma?	In this Loka, we lie everyday for something. Sometimes we call it white lies as we say those not to hurt our loved ones. The intention behind that is good but it is still a lie. Is it all bad karma then?	Similarly, there are many emotional confusions we go through everyday. Sometimes we give in and do something that justifies in our mind and sometimes we don't. How do I tell good from bad because it all can be relative. Please explain more in detail.	Thanks	Annie",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	Yes, there is no absolute list of dos and don's, good and bad.	What you do as per your Dharma is good Karma and what you do against your Dharma adds to your bad Karmas.	Now Dharma is also soul specific. In any situation, two different souls can have two different Dharmas. When you are in a situation, you should decide what is your Dharma. In the example given by you, you should ask yourself, \"Is my Dharma telling truth or keeping my loved one happy?\" Then do what your Dharma says. That would count as your good Karma.	If you read Mahabharata, you can know concept of Dharma better.	Blessings",

      answer: "Divine Soul,	If any activity of your body is stopping you from rising at the level of soul, then you should try to avoid that activity. Any activity which stimulates your senses makes you body-bound. Selling non-veg doesn't stimulate your senses. Eating non-veg does. And if you are a learned Yogi, then you can distance yourself from activity of your body-mind and witness them having pleasure without getting affected by it. So if you have realized that you and the body are two different things, then even eating non-veg is not any hindrance. For beginners only it is advised to stay away from anything which gives pleasure to senses and make the seeker body-bound. For advanced seekers it doesn't matter.	Blessings",

Also gold was what I think was her bed made of . I remember two more things which I have no clue why - one Was I was led to her bedside by a small girl who held my hand and as if guiding me through those thousands of lines of people so that I don't get lost , taking secret shortcuts - when I reached her bedside she called me near and whispered something in my ear. I DO NOT REMBER IT. It's something that I wish I remember . Secondly right after that , after she whispered something her bed was raised or picked up by the people around her and she was taken away. Again the girl led me out and I woke up. I till date try to decipher the dream. You think the Setuu masters can help me out in seeking the truth out .",

Today I read the chapter about Linga Shastra. It has definitely 'peeled off' few more layers of assumptions. But one thought keeps lingering in my mind. We had already discussed about 'the good' and 'the bad' in previous conversation. Your answer to that query was satisfactory. But in this chapter, I once again came across these words viz; the good and the bad OR the positive and the negative. Lord Vishnu is all about positivity. Lord Shiva is all about perfect balance of the positive and the negative. How do these Gods define positive and negative? For example, the tiger eats the cow. Is Tiger a negative force? Is it a bad fellow? Tiger kills its prey for survival. Is he bad? A thief robs a person. Is the thief bad? He does it for his own survival. It appears that 'the good' and 'the bad' are relative terms. What is 'good' for me, may not be good for others. What is bad for me, may be good for others. How should we look at these terminologies? Thank You for reading. I humbly request you to show me the path.",
      answer: "Divine Soul,	There is a 3 dimensional space around you. Your body moves in that space. How do you denote that space geometrically? You draw three axis : x-axis, y-axis, z-axis. You can denote location of an object in the graph of these axes.	The way body moves in space dimensions, your soul moves in the Karma-desire dimensions. Imagine your soul as a point in the graph of x,y,z axis. In every axis there is positive side and negative side.	So when you do something in this world which accumulates negative Karma on you, your soul moves on negative side of Karma-axis. And when you do positive Karma, your soul moves in the positive side of Karma-axis. This way your soul's Karma-Desire coordinates keep changing. It is similar to change of location of your body in space.	If your soul remains at negative side of axis (AsurLoka), then also you are trapped in the illusion. If you are only at positive side (i.e. you are in VishnuLoka), then also you are trapped. Even if you are at zero (In BrahmaLoka), you are trapped. If you keep oscillating between negative and positive i.e. if you are indifferent to both positives and negatives (in ShivaLoka), then also you are trapped.	The truth lies beyond positives and negatives.	Blessings",

        These are queries submitted by devotees on which Setuu has spoken.
        Queries can be answered at 4 levels : <br />
        (1) Sadhakas <br />
        (2) Setuu Masters <br />
        (3) Mathangs <br />
        (4) Lord Hanuman. <br />
        <br />
        You can submit your queries in "My Experiences" section of your profile.
        Only those queries are displayed publicly which we think can benefit
        other devotees. All experiences submitted by devotees remain anonymous.
        If one of the queries seen below was submitted by you, and you do not
        want it to be seen publicly, you can either delete the query by going
        to "My Experiences" section of your devotee profile. Or you can simply
        email us at{" "}
